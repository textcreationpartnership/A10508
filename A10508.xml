            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any learned diſcourſes have beene delivered out of this ſear, of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry points of the renowmed art of Chirurgerie by Maſter Doctor <hi>Gwyn</hi> of famous memorie, who by reaſon of his not vulgar learning, hath left an eternall memorie in the mindes of thoſe who knew him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, to himſelfe. God having called him out of this tranſitorie life, and vale of miſerie, to reſt from his labours, it ſeemed good to the Governors of this worſhipfull Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to have this exerciſe performed by the moſt able of the brethren as it ſhould come to every one according to his place and dignitie. And undoubtedly this office hath
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16145:9"/>beene performed by moſt, laudably, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>itfully to the praiſe of the Hall, and mutuall communication of skill, for the better performing of duties which ſo high a calling doth require. And ſurely if this courſe had beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, it had mightily encreaſed in readers the theoricall or contemplative part, which doth conſiſt in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the precepts, had made them able to give greater contentment to their patients by their rationall diſcourſes, and more emboldened them in particular operations, having ſufficient warrant of Art for their practice, and abilitie to convince empyrickes and malitious calumniators. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as I underſtand) the higheſt power of this Realm, from whom there is no appeale, hath decreed that this exerciſe ſhall be performed by a Doctor of Phyſicke, and that the worſhipfull Company hath for the preſent made choiſe of mee, who profeſſe my ſelfe to bee a member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; I ſhall labour by diligence to ſupply all defects in mee, which ſundrie may find in mee, if they compare my weakeneſſe, with the ableneſſe of my predeceſſor. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the matter falleth out. I will endevour to deliver what is for the purpoſe of that ſubject whereof I reade, although not all peradventure which might bee alledged to the purpoſe. Nevertheleſſe I mean not to be ſo ſparing in my diſcourſes, as that you ſhall have occaſion to thinke that any thing abſolutely requiſite hath beene kept backe. And if it fall out that at any time I checke or controule thoſe authors, who by ſome are highly eſteemed; I deſire that none aſcribe this to any ambition or vaine glorie in mee before thy weigh my reaſons in the impartiall bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of judgement. And as it is impoſſible for any man, who curiouſly and ſcrupulouſly treadeth in another mans footſteps, to compaſſe a long journey in a day: So let none thinke that ever hee ſhall bee famous in his art, if hee give himſelfe only to imitation of others. The ancients have left not a little to bee found out by the diligence of poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Whoſoever is induſtrious and judicious ſhall find
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16145:9"/>my words to bee an oracle. Many of them have ſet down ſundrie things not tryed by experience, but imagined by their fancie, which the ſickle of tryall will prune. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, in reprehenſion I will uſe them reſpectively, by reaſon of reverence, which is due to antiquitie. Beſides this nothing can bee both invented and perfected. Now ſeeing in all the diſcourſes and lectures which have beene delivered out of this place, only particular points of the Art have been handled, and none hath taken the paines to touch any Praecognita, or generall notions, which may be inſtead of an Introduction to the particulars, ſeeing no ſubject hath been delivered, or commended to mee, I will briefly though ſome Introductorie points, which will give no ſmall light to the lectures, which hereafter ſhall bee read.<note place="margin">The Praecogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</note> The firſt ſhall bee of antiquitie and dignitie of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie. The ſecond ſhall be of moſt famous authors, who have taken the paines to illuſtrate it, by their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: The third ſhall be of its place in the courſe of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie. The fourth of the definition of it: The fift of the diviſion or parts of it. Which things when I have ſet downe, I ſhall ſhut up this lecture; permitting election to the Governours, whether they will have mee proceed methodically, through the whole courſe of Chirurgerie, or ſcatteredly to handle diſperſed parts of the ſame as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath beene done. My opinion is,<note place="margin">The intention of the autor.</note> that it will bee both more fruitfull and pleaſing to intelligent hearers (if God will grant mee life and health) to paſſe through all the points of Chirurgerie methodically: for firſt the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of the parts will help the memorie: And who ſhall bee aſſiduous hearers ſhall not by ſnatches take a hungrie morſell; but have a full banquet, fully to anſwer the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. When I come to particulars, I will not only deliver the principles of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and their ſectators the Arabians: but I will acquaint you with the theorems of the Chimiſts, and compare the opinions of both, that it may bee known who have beene moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16145:10"/>nurſed in the boſome of nature. Of the Chymiſts <hi>Paracelſus</hi> is the Generall.<note place="margin">The chiefe Chymiſts.</note> He hath ſundrie Colonels
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, as <hi>Petrus Severinus</hi> the Dane, <hi>Quercetan, Petrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and ſundrie others, who are oftentimes clouds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out raine; more fraughted with bountifull promiſes, than reall performances. Now to come to touch the firſt generall point of Chirurgerie,<note place="margin">The antiquity of Chirurgerie.</note> which is the antiquitie of it, I dare bee bold to affirme, that of all arts liberall, it was the firſt which was invented after the fall: for as for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricultura</hi> and <hi>are paſtoralis,</hi> husbandrie and grazing, they would have beene required of man, if hee had continued in the ſtate of innocencie, to have furniſhed unto him nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and other things requiſite for the enjoying of this life contentedly, untill hee ſhould have beene tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from earth to heaven to enjoy the beatificall viſion of his Creator. Now it is moſt probable, I may ſay demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that what ſtrange event did firſt miniſter occaſion to invent an art, that that art was firſt enquired for and found out. Such was the wounding and killing of <hi>Abel,</hi> by his brother <hi>Cain,</hi> by reaſon of emulation. This could not but move <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> himſelfe to ſtudie how they might not only repell violence, but have in readineſſe means to cure hurts alſo, if they ſhould have beene woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and their lives ſpared. All things which were done before the floud are uncertaine and unknowne, if you except thoſe things which that eminent Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, hath recorded. You may reade of bragging <hi>Lamech, Geneſ</hi> 4 23 who boaſted of murthering. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſides this the wickedneſſe of man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. ſufficient to ſet him on, and that there were before the floud, giants and mightie men, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and ſo able to performe by violence of villanie. Shall any man thinke that men unable to reſiſt, did not think upon remedies to cure their hurts, being endued with reaſon; but as dogges licked their own wounds, and provided no means for curing contuſions, fractures, diſlocations, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16145:10"/>ſuch accidents as follow after violence offered. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Phyſicke, being ſo neere to the creation,<note place="margin">Phyſick not ſo ancient as Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie.</note> living long even to 969 yeares, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.27. as <hi>Methuſelah</hi> did, it is like they uſed none, ſeeing they had no other ſicknes but that of old age: which falleth out, the naturall and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall heat exhauſting the radicall moyſture, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable after that the ſentence of mortalitie was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſteritie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10. Thus wee ſee that as the practice of Chirurgerie was neceſſarie before the floud, ſo wee cannot gather by any obſcure conjectures, that that part of Phyſicke, which cureth by exhibiting internall medicaments, was in uſe. Yea untill the time of <hi>Hiprocrates.</hi> Phyſicke it ſelfe ſeemeth to have beene only a knowledge of ſimples, fit for curing of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall diſeaſes, and outward griefes found out by experience: and that there were but few precepts concerning the art, ſhewing either the knowledge of particular griefes, or the method of curing of them; They, who are accompted the autors and inventors of Phyſick, prove this to bee true:<note place="margin">The inventors of Phyſick.</note> Amongſt the Grecians, <hi>Apollo</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Lato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> is accompted the firſt, which gave his mind to the ſtudie of Phyſick and Chirurgery.

All theſe are in the ſixt ſection of his workes. <hi>Galen</hi> ſucceeded him about ſix hundred years after, a man worthy of eternall memory, who did illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate <hi>Hippocrates</hi> with his learned commentaries, and by adding of thoſe things, which were wanting, did perfect the art. In his workes are ſundrie Treatiſes, concerning Chirurgicall ſubject. The reſt of the Greeke writers fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, as <hi>Paulus</hi> of Aegina, <hi>Aetius, Alex. Trallianus, Oribaſius, Actuarius</hi> and the reſt. Amongſt the Latines <hi>Celſus</hi> excelleth, who hath written acurately of all Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgicall operations, whom all modern writers doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly commend; as <hi>Fallopius de tumoribus praeter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam, cap.</hi> 1. And <hi>Fabricius ab aqua pendente</hi> in ſundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the reſt. Of ſome, who went before him, thus he writeth: <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 1.

The Arabians follow; amongſt whom <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicen</hi> is the chiefeſt, who lived 1100 yeares after Chriſt: of Chirurgicall matters hee diſcourſeth in the third booke of his canon, and in the fourth part of his Canticles. <hi>Raſes</hi> 2.

So much I thought good to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the antiquitie, dignitie, and of the chiefe profeſſors of Chirurgerie; which ought to ſtirre up your diligence in labouring, to excell in the particular operations of it, and to reſolve to contemne the obloquies and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of rude and ill bred perſons, who ſhall ſeeme to ſlight this excellent art. If you inquire for the beginning of it, it is <hi>vetuſtiſsima</hi> moſt ancient, according to <hi>Celſus</hi> in the place above mentioned: If you require certaintie, it is grounded upon experience, and offereth it ſelfe to the eye: If you aske who did of old practiſe it, you ſhall finde that either they were numbred amongſt the gods, or were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed perſons, called heroes, as <hi>Hercules, Chiron, Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> or men of eminent learning and worth, as <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Avicen,</hi> and ſundrie others.<note place="margin">The ſubject of Chirurgerie.</note> It hath for its ſubject the body of man, and in this point no whit inferiour to Phyſick it ſelfe.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16145:12"/>which ſheweth how a family is to bee governed, and Policie, which teacheth how a Commonwealth is to bee ruled: Theſe wee will leave, becauſe they belong not to our purpoſe: as neither thoſe arts, which are meerly factive, commonly called mechanicall, and ſo unworthy of a Philoſopher. The ſpeculative part of philoſophie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth under it the Metaphyſicks,<note place="margin">Ariſe. <hi>6.</hi> Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſ c. <hi>1.</hi>

The ſubject of naturall philoſophie is <hi>corpus naturale,</hi> or a naturall body: Now of all naturall bodies, the body of man is the chiefeſt &amp; moſt excellent, which moved the kingly Prophet to burſt out into this reſolution: <hi>Laudabo te, quia mirabiliter forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſum:</hi> I will praiſe thee, becauſe I am wonderfully fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: The admirable compoſition of the body of man drew from <hi>Galen</hi> himſelfe, not the beſt maſter of pietie, a hymne to his Creator.

The firſt is performed by that art, which here is called phyſick; the ſecond by Chirurgerie. So that Chirurgerie is the ſecond branch of the cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of medicine, without the which neither countrie, citie, towne, village, hamlet, yea no private familie can well continue or ſubſiſt. This wee muſt confeſſe, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider unto how many externall injuries the body of man is ſubject, as to ſcaldings, fractures, luxations, wounds, ulcers, ruptures, ſtone, and to what not: So that the uſe of Chirurgerie is by reaſon of abſolute neceſſitie more often required, than the miniſtration of medicaments.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16145:12"/>And ſeeing the operation of a Chirurgion is more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the eye and other ſenſes, than the exhibition of medicaments is, it behoveth every one to bee well verſt in that which he taketh in hand, ſeeing his practice is more ſubject to cenſure: There bee a number of empyricall knaves, filthie bands, and bold queanes, who daylie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter medicaments boldly, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is not a ſcience properly, becauſe it reſteth not in only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but an art as Phyſick it ſelfe is: for it leaveth an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect after the operation, to wit, health: So that for the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> it hath the ſame with Phyſick it ſelfe: Both Phyſick and Chirurgerie propoſe to themſelves one end: yet the meanes are divers.

The ſecond part of Chirurgerie oppoſite to the firſt, teacheth to ſeparate parts unnaturally united: where either the comely compoſition of the body of man is defaced or empaired, or the actions of the ſame hindred. Sundrie have beene brought into the world with the <hi>anus</hi> and <hi>vulva</hi> quite ſhut up. The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that membrane, which is found in the necke of the matrix of ſome women, is in this place to bee noted and conſidered: Seeing there have beene and yet are ſo many concertations amongſt both skilfull Phyſitians and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons.

                  </gap>: of it I meane diligently to diſcourſe, becauſe it is a dangerous operation, and many times ſcandalous. Laſt of all, I come to the fourth and laſt principall part of Chirurgerie,<note place="margin">IV. Part of Chirurgerie</note> which is the ſupplying of the defects of the body, which may be called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>additrix</hi> the ſupplying or adding part. Now things which are added, are either of the body it ſelfe, as reſtoring of the Noſe loſt, or curing of the hare lip. Of the firſt, I will ſet down the method of the Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Phyſitians, and Chirurgeons: Of the ſecond, my own and other famous mens experiments in curing both the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and the double hare-lip. The matter of things, which is uſed for repairing of the loſſes in other parts, as the eye, the eate, arme, and legge, is no wayes of the nature of the body. Nevertheleſſe when I am come ſo far, I will make an end of the courſe of Chirurgerie with touching theſe ſo much as ſhall ſeem ſufficient, to inſtruct ſuch as have not beene verſt in theſe practices. I have run through thoſe five introductorie points of Chirurgerie, to wit of the antiquitie and dignitie of it: of the profeſſors of it, of its place amongſt the liberall arts, of the definition and parts of the ſame. As concerning the two laſt points, I have varied from all who have written of this ſubject: Nevertheleſſe I have the light of nature on my ſide, and the experience of all skilfull practitioners. So that it is needleſſe to take further paines, either to confirme thoſe things which I have alleaged, or to refute that which hath been ſaid by others; Seeing I intend rather to frame an able operating Chirurgeon, than to ſet out a contentions diſputing theorician: Beſides, reprehending of others doth not ſo much inſtruct the hearers in the knowledge of the truth, as ſheweth that, which is not to bee learned, but ſhunned. Neither is a Chirurgeon contented to have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16145:14"/>performed ſo many duties to the body of man while it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live and the inſtrument of the ſoule, for performing acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but when it is dead the ſpirit returning to God, who gave it, hee ceaſeth not to bee officious to it, in diſſecting of it, for the inſtruction of himſelfe and others, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it from putrefaction and annoyance, untill time and place fit for burying of it bee offered: which hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth partly, by encearing of it, partly by embaulming: of the which two laſt, I meane alſo to diſcourſe: That the Chirurgeon, which I meane to frame, may bee compleat. I have now preſented to the view of the eyes of your underſtanding, this Chirurgicall Canaan: Into the which I meane to bring you, not to uſe the native inhabitants hardly, as <hi>Ioſhua</hi> did the Canaanites and their things: but mutually to enjoy the uſe of thoſe good things which you ſhall find with them. If I proceed orderly, I muſt enter into the doctrine of Tumors, which will bee both pleaſing and profitable in my firſt lecture. It is a ſubject, which is moſt frequently offered, and from whence the meaneſt of all the brethren, which practiſeth, is not exempted.

Firſt, I will declare what a Tumor is. Secondly, which are cauſes of Tumors: Thirdly, which are the maine differences of Tumors.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Tumor.</note>Before I come to the eſſentiall definition of a Tumor, I Will ſet down the denominations of it. A Tumor in Greeke is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, a prominence or protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the bodie. And from hence the Latine words <hi>uncus</hi> a crooke or hooke, and <hi>aduncus</hi> bended or crooked, are derived: Becauſe things bended cauſe a ſticking out. The Arabians and barbarous Phyſitians, who follow them, call all Tumors unnaturall <hi>Apoſtemata,</hi> in Latine <hi>abſceſſus:</hi> this word is derived from the greeke verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>abſcedere:</hi> Becauſe in apoſtemes there is a collection of humors in any place, which have left their own proper ſeat &amp;c. For hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which cauſe Apoſtemes, come from the veines, and ſo leaving ther own naturall receptacle, ſeat themſelves in other parts of the body, being dependant and weake. And Chirurgeans commonly call Tumors wherein there is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of matter Apoſtemes. <hi>Tumor,</hi> which is a Latine word, and by frequent uſe made familiar in Engliſh confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and diſcourſes, is derived from the Latine word <hi>Tumeo,</hi> to bee raiſed or puffed up: And from <hi>Tumor</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>Tumulus</hi> a grave: becauſe it is raiſed up higher than the ground adjacent to it. Now bunchings or ſtickings out of parts of the body, are threefold:<note place="margin">Differences of Tumors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16145:16"/>body are threefold: for either they are naturall, and then they ſerve for the comelineſſe of the body, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and further the actions, as we may ſee in the head, belly, joints; the thighs, calves of the legs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and armes: or they only paſſe the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dimenſions of ſome parts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſuch are the dugs full of milk, and the bellies of women which are with child: Or they are altogether unnaturall, not only marring the comely compoſition of that part of the body which they poſſeſſe; but hindering the actions alſo. Such a tumor, or eminence of the body, is called by <hi>Galen</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, id eſt, <hi>tumor praeter naturam,</hi> a Tumor contrary to nature. Having ſet downe the denominations of a Tumor, I muſt come to the definition of it. Seeing ſo many as have written of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors have ſet down one definition, or another, if I ſhould ſet downe all the ſeverall definitions, which are by divers authors ſet downe, and inſiſt in the refutation of ſuch defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions as offend againſt the conditions of a good defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhould rather ſeeme to the judicious, to make an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation of reading, and wit, than a care of the profiting of the hearers. Of all the definitions, two are chiefly to bee noted: the one of <hi>Fallopius</hi> in his treatiſe of tumors: <hi>c.</hi> 3. The other of <hi>Hieron. Fabricius ab aqua pendent. in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peribus Chirurgicis, part.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de tumorib. cap.</hi> 1. That of <hi>Fallopius</hi> is gathered out of <hi>Galen, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 13. <hi>de method. medendi:</hi> and it is thus. It is a diſeaſe, whereby the parts loſe their naturall bigneſſe, exceeding it. So that exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation is contrary to a tumor. Hee will have it to bee a diſeaſe of the inſtrumentorie parts: for quantity is only an inſtrument, whereby the organicall parts performe their actions, more ſtrongly, or weakly, as wee may ſee in dwarfs, and tall men. <hi>Galen lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de tumorib praet. nat. c.</hi> 1. affirmeth that in tumors contrarie to nature, all dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is, length, height and breadth are increaſed. But the former definition cannot bee aſcribed to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tumor, and ſo it is not large enough: for in an <hi>Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> extreme heat rather offendeth, than the bignes enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16145:16"/>which very often cannot bee deprehended by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.<note place="margin">The definition of <hi>Fabricius.</hi>
                  </note> The definition ſet downe by <hi>Fabricius ab aqua pendente</hi> is this: A Tumor againſt nature, is a diſeaſe for the moſt part compounded, which is to bee named of that thing, which hindereth the actions. And ſeeing to a crow, her own birds ſeem faireſt, for if any one ſet under her, hens egges to bee hatched, that they may have cocks of the game, they muſt watch for the time of diſcloſing, leſt ſhee kill them: So hee to make his definition plauſible to his readers, will have all to mark ſome remarkable points in his definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And firſt of all, in that he calleth a Tumor againſt nature <hi>morbus,</hi> or a diſeaſe, he will not have puſhes in the face, and ſuch ſmall eminences of the skin to be Tumors, becauſe they hinder not the actions: hee cannot deny that the equalitie of the skin is altered, and beſides this, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the skin, which is perſpiration, in that place is hindered. Let no man think it harſh, that I aſcribe action unto the skin, being a ſimple and ſimilary part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: it cannot bee denied that all ſimilary parts have an uſe, which uſe ſometimes is an action, as this of the skin; to ſend out by the pores of it fuliginous vapors, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous ſeroſitie of the bloud by inſenſible perſpiration and ſweat. And although ſuch ſmall eminences commonly are denied to bee diſeaſes, becauſe they hinder not the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; yet they be paſſions, and affections, which require the skill of the Phyſitian and Chirurgean: yea thoſe puſhes of the face are ſomtimes more hard to be cured than great Tumors, and Artiſts many times gaine more by thoſe, than theſe: beſides this, by reaſon of the matter they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to one or other of the maine Tumors. Howſoever they are not to be neglected. According to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 1. <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric. c.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp; Galen. ad Thraſibulum,</hi>

He addeth that a Tumor is a diſeaſe moſt commonly compounded; if hee had ſaid ever compounded, hee had ſpoken a truth: for in every one of theſe Tumors, there is a Tumor conſpicuous or latent; or a ſolution of unitie, either ſenſible or imaginary. In an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> it ſelf, wherein there appeareth neither quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of part increaſed, nor ſolution of unity procured; yet in it there are undoubtedly both: for the firſt, ſeeing there is ſo great a heat in the part poſſeſſed with this griefe, the Humors muſt bee rarified, and the part dilated, which will require a more ſpatious place than it had before, which is an evident argument, that the quantity is inlarged. As for the ſecond, the parts before arctly united muſt be ſomwhat ſeparated by ſtretching: Reaſon muſt teach us that which cannot bee deprehended by the ſenſes. The laſt clauſe of the definition, That the Tumor is to bee named from that which hindereth the action, as <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> a diſeaſe of diſtemperature, becauſe heat doth moſt hinder the action of the part: this is frivolous, becauſe not heat only, but the bedewing of the skin with choler, by the which it is ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, hindered the contraction and extenſion of the skin, and ſo by a neceſſary conſequence, the hindering of the motion of the part organicall, wherein it is ſeated. To conclude, this definition may bee applyed to other griefes than a Tumor, as to the head-ache, which is a diſeaſe moſt commonly compounded of diſtemperature of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and ſolution of unitie, and may have its denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the diverſity of the humor cauſing it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing neither the definition of <hi>Fallopius</hi> out of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> nor the definition of <hi>Fabricius ab aqua pendente,</hi> can abide the triall of the lawes of a good definition, wee muſt aſſay to give another, which ſhall be this: A Tumor againſt nature is moſt frequently a diſeaſe, ſomtimes a light
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16145:17"/>affection, for the moſt part incident to the organicall parts, increaſing their quantity above nature, by reaſon of receiving of ſuperfluous humors ſent from other parts. Here I will labour to yeeld a reaſon for every point of this definition. The <hi>genus</hi> is a griefe,<note place="margin">The definition of the author.</note> becauſe it hindereth the actions, ſomtimes it is a paſſion or light affection, which hindereth not the action of the part, as appeareth in ſmall <hi>adomatous</hi> Tumors, and <hi>ſcirrhoſities:</hi> and therefore theſe modifications frequently, and ſomtimes are added. The ſubject of a Tumor is a part organicall, ſomtimes by its own nature organicall, as a finger or toe, ſomtimes organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call only by office, as when the uſe of a ſimilarie part is performed by an action: as it appeareth in the skin, one of the uſes whereof, is to ſend forth by its pores inſenſible perſpirations, fuliginous vapors, ſuperfluous ſeroſity of the bloud by ſweat, and ichors of humors in the beginning of Tumors, and declination by diſcuſſive and reſolutive medicaments. The forme of a Tumor is quantitie increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whereby it differeth from all other griefes.<note place="margin">The cauſe of quantity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</note> The cauſe of increaſe of quantitie, is receiving of ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which is done two manner of wayes, to wit, affluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and congeſtion. Affluxion is,<note place="margin">Affluxion.</note> when a humor offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding either in quantity or quality, ſuddenly with violence ſeizeth upon any member, either by reaſon of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, the rarity, looſeneſſe, dependancy, heat, or pain, or becauſe the whole body is full, or cacochymicall, and the parts ſending ſtrong.

A part alſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is weake by reaſon of the ſituation, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant parts are more apt to receive influence of humors, as the more high are to receive Halitus; ſo it is often ſeene,

In this matter I will leave all needleſſe and fruitleſſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Tumors, from time, as that ſome are new, ſome old, ſome ſhort, ſome long enduring: from the quantity, as that ſome are ſmall, ſome great, ſome of a meane big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: from the condition of them, as that ſome are milde, ſome maligne, ſome curable, ſome uncurable, and ſuch like; which either doe not greatly further the knowledge and curation of Tumors, or elſe are to bee ſet downe to ſome purpoſe in the explication of every particular Tumor. Onely now in my generall diſcourſe of Tumors, which is to ſhew light unto that which ſhall hereafter be ſpoken in the ſpeciall doctrine of each, I will meddle with the differences taken from the materiall cauſe of Tumors, from whence

Of the divers kindes of it, which have their denominations from their places, and of the diverſities which ariſe from the complication of it with other Humors, I meane to diſcourſe when I come to the particular tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: for I meane not to confound particulars with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, becauſe this would breed confuſion, and ſo deprive the memory of fruit of that which is delivered. Of all other Tumors a <hi>Phlegmone</hi> deſerveth the firſt place, becauſe it is cauſed of bloud, which is the ſon of nature, firſt begotten, and the treaſure of life.

You ſee how I have ſet down ſix ſimple Tumors, for fewer I cannot, if you conſider either the diverſity of the materiall cauſes, or the diverſity of the topicall applications, or the evidence of doctrine. The combination of theſe beget the compound Tumors; in theſe compound Tumors,<note place="margin">Compound Tumors.</note> what Humor is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, that carrieth away the denomination: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if bloud abound more than choler, the Tumor is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and ſo in all other combinations of Humor in Tumors, which ſhall be preſented to your view. When you have noted the Pathognomonical ſignes of each of the ſimple principall Tumors, it is an eaſie matter at the firſt ſight to diſcerne the kinde of Tumor, and what compound medicaments are to be applied to it. Hitherto have I declared unto you the opinion of <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and of the reſt of the Grecians, as alſo of the Arabians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the materiall cauſes of Tumors. Now to fulfill my promiſe, I will ſhew you what <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and his followers thinke of this point: Firſt then they acknowledge but two elements, water and earth; for if they ſhould not grant ſo much, they could not be accounted in the number of the faithfull; for in the very firſt Verſes of <hi>Geneſis</hi> mention is made of both. Secondly,<note place="margin">The Humors are not parts of the body.</note> they account the Humors parts of the body, and ſo the cauſes of no griefes, but erroneouſly, for if they were parts, they would bee endued with life, which they are not. Thirdly, they would have ſome action, whereof they alſo are deprived: onely they have an uſe, which is to nouriſh the parts. Beſides this, they maliciouſly diſſemble the doctrine of the rationall Phyſitians and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, for they make each Humor, contained in the maſſe of bloud, either naturall, or againſt nature: the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall they make, either alimentary, which nouriſheth the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16145:21"/>parts, or ſuperfluous, which nature reſerveth for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſes: of this abounding, diſeaſes proceeding of fulneſſe are ingendred, called <hi>Plethora:</hi> of the Humor againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cauſing impurity, <hi>Cacochymia</hi> is cauſed; ſo choler in the veines and arteries is naturall, and alimentary. In the <hi>Cyſtis fellis,</hi> and in the <hi>Porus biliarius,</hi> the ſuperfluous is contained: if it leave the appointed receptacles, and paſſe to the habit of the body, it cauſeth the yellow jaundize; if by aduſtion, it become <hi>Bilis atra,</hi> it procureth Cancers and Wolfes;<note place="margin">What Humors cauſe diſeaſes.</note> ſo that they hold not the naturall, but thoſe that are unnaturall to be cauſes of diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The principles of all things according to <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and his followers.</note>The Paracelſians appoint three principles of all things, <hi>Sal, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercurie,</hi> and not onely by reſemblance, or allegorically, but really: By Sulphur, they underſtand the fattie ſubſtance; by Mercurie, the wateriſh ſubſtance; by ſalt, the earthy ſubſtance: Diſtill Cloaves, there come two humidities, the oile and ſpirit: in the bottome the earthy ſubſtance ſtayeth, which hath two parts, <hi>Terra repurgata,</hi> the cryſtalline ſalt, and <hi>Terra mortua,</hi> the blacke earth. The life of the ſalt is a ſtrong water,<note place="margin">The life of ſalt.</note> which if it be by diſtillation drawne, it leaveth but a <hi>Terra damnata,</hi> onely fit for the dunghill.<note place="margin">The effect and benefit of ſalt.</note> This ſalt preſerveth the body from putrifaction, wherefore Chriſt called his Diſciples the ſalt of the earth, becauſe by the preaching of the Goſpell, and adminiſtration of the healthfull Sacraments, they procured to the unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full the life of grace, who before were but <hi>Terra damnata;</hi> and by a wonderfull tranſmutation of terreſtriall creatures, made them ſpirituall, repreſenting the Angels, yea God himſelfe, by reſtoring his image. From defects in theſe three,<note place="margin">The cauſes of diſeaſes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Chymiſts.</note> they will have all diſeaſes to proceed: and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tumors againſt nature, the hot they will have to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Sulphur and Mercurie, and the hotter it is, the more Sulphur to concurre. The cold Tumors they will have to proceed from Mercury and Salt, and according to the looſeneſſe, or firmeneſſe of the Tumor, the more Salt or Mercurie to be required, as in <hi>Oedema</hi> more Mercurie, in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16145:21"/>
                  <hi>Scirrbus</hi> more Salt. This is their doctrine concerning the materiall cauſes of Tumors, in my judgement it is the ſalfeſt courſe to inſiſt in the foot-ſteps of the ancient, for their way is plain and eaſie; no man can deny that there are foure Humors in the maſſe of bloud, as may appeare when it is drawne out of the veines: Choler ſwimmeth about the bloud, which is known by its bright redneſſe; Melancholy is in the bottome, which is deprehended by its groſſeneſſe and blackneſſe; now Flegme uniteth theſe two laſt Humors, and maketh them tough. The Paracelſian doctrine is full of difficulties, which hee maketh more obſcure by coyning ſtrange words, as his Reader will perceive; ſo that his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are but a kinde of canting Philoſophie. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, I thought good in plaine termes to acquaint you with it, that when any Empericke ſhall make a ſhew of learning, by uſing theſe termes, you may finde him out, and eſteeme of him as he is: that is, like that head which the Wolfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre off eſpied, repreſenting the head of a living man, but comming neere, and ſeeing it but curiouſly carved, affirmed it to be <hi>Pulchrum caput, ſed ſine ſcientia,</hi> A comely head, but without wit.</p>

                  </gap> this is twofold, <hi>Pura,</hi> when there is a due proportion of the Humors of the body, and <hi>Impura,</hi> when there is an exceſſe of any of the three Humors beſides bloud, as Choler Flegm, or Melancholy. <hi>Ad vires</hi> is when there is ſuch a fulneſſe, as cauſeth ſluggiſhneſſe of the body: this requireth evacuation of Phlebotomie, as <hi>Cacochymia</hi> by purgation. As for Phlebotomie, three things are to bee obſerved concerning it. I. The manner: In ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Quoad vaſa,</hi> at one time ſo much blood is to bee drawne as is requiſite; but in fulneſſe, <hi>Quoad vires,</hi> becauſe ſtrength is ſomewhat abated, you are to draw bloud by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, and not all at one time. II. Is the quantity, how much then is to bee drawne, the weakneſſe or ſtrength of the party will informe you; for in a weake body you are to draw leſſe, in a ſtrong body more, ſtrength and weakneſſe are to bee diſcerned by the functions: the weakneſſ of the naturall faculty is diſcerned by crudity of Urine, and excrements of the body: the weakneſſe of the vitall, by a weake and ſmall pulſe, as alſo breathing weake and thicke: the weakneſſe of the animall function is found out by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in moving and feeling; by the integrity and perfection of theſe three faculties the ſtrength of the party is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: But we muſt diligently diſtinguiſh beweene langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and weakneſſe indeed,<note place="margin">Weakneſſe and oppreſſion dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</note> and oppreſſion of faculties by reaſon of fulneſſe, making them dull and ſlow; for as in weakneſſe, great moderation is to be uſed, ſo in oppreſſion we may more bountifully and boldly ſuffer the veine to run. The third thing to bee obſerved in Phlebotomie is the end of it, whereof it is inſtituted; the ſcopes of bloud-letting are two, Derivation and Revulſion: Derivation is the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16145:22"/>of the Humor to the part adiacent, or of the ſame ſide, by opening of that veine, or a branch of it, which is inſerted into the part affected: as for example, if in diſeaſes of the head or necke, we open the <hi>Cephalica</hi> in the ſame ſide: and even in this there is a kinde of oppoſition, to wit, high and low; or in Tumors of the groyne, we open <hi>Vena poplitis:</hi> this they doe alſo who open this veine in <hi>Podagra,</hi> if the gout invade the foot. This kinde of interception we uſe, not onely becauſe there is a plentifull fluxion to the part affected, but becauſe a ſpeedy interception is required, leſt the naturall heat of the part be oppreſſed, or the rupture of a veſſell enſue: ſo in inflamation of the lungs, and ſide, wee open the liver veine of the ſame ſide, and draw bloud plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully. Revulſion is a drawing of the Humor to a part op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite: of this there be foure differences: I. From the higher to the lower parts, as from the head to the feet. II. From the right ſide to the left. III. From the fore part to the backe, which wee ſhall doe if we apply Leeches in diſeaſes of the breſt or belly. IV. Is when we draw from the center unto the circumference, as in applying Ventoſes with Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification to the necke in diſeaſes of the braine, as in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexie, and Lethargie Veſicatories performe the ſame.</p>
               <p>But one may aske which we to be accounted high,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> and which low.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That all thoſe parts which are above the navell,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> including alſo the liver and ſtomacke, are accounted high; but the parts below the liver, are accounted low, as the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and genitals in man and woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ends of Revulſion.</note>This kinde of interception we uſe in two caſes: Firſt, if the matter flow but flowly, and ſo a ſudden interception is not required. Secondly, if we are to open a veine to prevent a diſeaſe, as <hi>Vena cubiti</hi> for to free one of a fit of the gout. But this kinde of drawing hath no place in contagious Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, if they appeare either in the upper or lower parts; for whether they appeare either behinde the eares, and arme-pits in the upper parts, or in the groynes in the lower,

               <p>Now there is a difference between Revulſion, Derivation, and Evacuation, for in the former two, motion is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as you have heard, but in vacuation the Humors muſt be quiet.

               <p>Firſt, by the rectitude of the parts, as the left with the left, and right with the right, and the hinder with the fore parts. Secondly, by the rectitude of the veſſels: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, The liver veine of the arme hath a kinde of ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with the veines aſcending to the head: ſo if one bleed immoderately at the right noſtrill, by applying a Ventoſe to the region of the liver, the flux ceaſeth: if it flow from the left noſtrill, it muſt be applied to the region of the ſpleene.</p>

Now this matter offending in quality, it either moveth from place to place, or it reſteth where it had its firſt invaſion; if it move from place to place, it is the ſafeſt courſe to abate the Humors wherein this quality is reſident by Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, leſt it ſeaze upon ſome principall part: if it be quiet, reſting contented with the firſt place, then let us uſe by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, expelling the Humor, whether it be choler, flegme, or melancholy, with appropriate medicaments, which Phyſick preſcribeth in that branch of the curative part of Phyſicke which reſtoreth health by the adminiſtration of inward me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments.

                  <note place="margin">Indications from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the humor.</note>Now the humor it ſelfe is either not contagious, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious: If it bee not contagious, the fluxion of it doth proceed from three cauſes: The firſt is the ſtrength of the part ſending the humor, which it doth, either becauſe it is burdened with the quantity, or pricked on by the quality; wee have ſhewed what is to be done in theſe caſes. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the thinneſſe of the humor. The third is the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the affected part. If fluxion be cauſed by reaſon of the thinneſſe of the humor, if we cannot uſe phlebotomie or purging, as in children, decrepit perſons, and in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with childe in the laſt moneth: then we muſt uſe revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and this is done ſix manner of wayes. I. By Ventoſes region of the liver, when one bleedeth too much at the right noſtrill. II. Painfull conſtriction, or binding of the parts, as armes, and legs: but wee muſt firſt rub hard the parts which are to be bound; and if we binde the arme, we muſt uſe a Ligature in three parts: 1. Neere the arme-pit. 2. A little above the elbow. 3. About the wriſt. In the legs we muſt uſe a Ligature neere the groyne, a little above the knee, and neere the anckle. III. Painfull frications when wee meane to revell from the center to the circumference. IV. Bathing of the parts with very hot water: for firſt by reaſon of the paine it doth revell. Secondly, it doth diſcuſſe becauſe it openeth the poores. And in fevers by bathing of the limmes ſleepe is procured, the vapours aſcending to the head. V. Veſicatories which are uſed in the Apoplexie, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie, and ſuch like. VI. Fontanels, and they are in great uſe to be applied to divers parts, for the preventing and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſundry griefes. If the fluxion be procured by the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the part affected, there be two cauſes of the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Firſt, the diſtemperature of the part. Secondly, paine. If diſtemperature of the part be the cauſe, it muſt be removed by its contrary: but ſeeing it is moſt commonly a hot diſtemperature, things cooling are to be applied, as by applying clothes moiſtened with oyle of Roſes, or violets
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16145:24"/>cold: but when the clouts become hot, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If wee apply unguents, as <hi>infrigidans Galeni, Roſatum Meſuis, de ceruſſa Raſis, Populeon,</hi> wee muſt not apply the unguent immediately to the skin; but a thin linnen cloth: for it keepeth the unguent from drying, and doth not hinder the breathing out of the vapors, which the immediate application of the unguent would doe, and ſo by ſtopping of the pores, would increaſe both the heat and paine.</p>
               <p>And in application, of pulteſes, they are to be ſpread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fouldings of a cloth, dipped in ſome convenient oyle or liniment; for ſo it doth not hinder perſpiration, and the applications are removed more eaſily from the part. This in your pratice is to bee noted, and the inveto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate error to bee ſhunned, if the wayes by the which the humor paſſeth, bee too ample and patent, and a hot diſtemperature joyned, then things aſtringent and cooling are to be applied, roulers and other cloaths being moyſtened in them. Wherefore in this caſe myrtils berries, red roſe leaves dried, pomgranate rindes and flowers, ſumach, ſloes, oaken and owlar barke boyled in red aſtringent wine, or vineger and water, or new and freſh Tanners wooſe, and ſtrained are effectuall.

There are two cauſes of paine, ſolution of unitie,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16145:24"/>and a venomous quality: if the ſolution of unity proceed from the affluxion of Humors hot or ſharpe diſtending the parts, the paine is to bee eaſed with medicaments conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: theſe are of two ſorts, <hi>Anodine,</hi> and <hi>Narcoticall: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes</hi> gently contemperate the part, by reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity which they have with the nature of man.

                  <hi>LECT. V.</hi> Of curing of a Tumor come to ſuppuration.</head>
               <p>HAving in my former Lecture ſet down, that all Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors end in one of theſe five wayes, to wit, diſcuſſion,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16145:27"/>apoſtemation, induration, corruption of the part, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from one part to another.</p>
               <p>Having ſhewed the method how they are to be diſcuſſed: Now order requireth that the meanes be ſet downe, how a Tumor is to bee handled, if it tend to ſuppuration, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation: which by our uſuall terme is called Apoſtemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus we are inforced ſo to goe to work:<note place="margin">When natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is to be procured.</note> Firſt, if the humor be too plentifull; for then the naturall heat cannot well rule it, and ſo it muſt bee ſeconded by forraine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall heate, which working vpon ſuperfluous humidity, cauſeth putrifaction according to the Philoſopher. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when it is crude; for then wee muſt labour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct it with the medicaments, which are <hi>peptica</hi> or <hi>coquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi> Thirdly, when the matter is hard; and then we muſt uſe emollient medicaments. The medicaments which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure quittour, they are temperately hot and moſt: and theſe help naturall heat, that it may the more eaſily elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the matter, and make it fit for expulſion, and this wee call concoction. Emollient topicks are uſed to ſoften any matter indurated, and ſuch are drie in the firſt degree; and hot in the firſt, and in the beginning of the ſecond. But it is to bee noted that there is a difference betweene tenſion and hardnes, and relaxation and ſoftnes: a part ſtretched will yeeld to the finger preſſing it; if it bee hard it will not: and where there is any tenſion, relaxing medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments are to bee applied, which attenuate and open the pores, and therefore they muſt more diſcuſſe than drie, and ſo be drying in the firſt degree, and hot in the ſecond. A part indurated muſt have emollient means applied to it: whereof wee will ſpeake, when wee come to diſcourſe of a <hi>ſchirru.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Indications in curing of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemes.</note> In the curation of Apoſtemes, wee are to doe two things: firſt, wee are to prepare the matter, and make it fit for expulſion: ſecondly, wee are to evacuate it, when it is prepared. To accompliſh the preparation of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, firſt,<note place="margin">Removing of accidents.</note> wee are to remove accidents: ſecondly, to procure the maturation of the matter.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16145:27"/>tenſion of the part, hardneſſe, and heat.<note place="margin">Aſſwaging of paine.</note> As for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaging of paine, narcoticall or ſtupefactive medicaments have no place here: for firſt, they extinguiſh the naturall heat of the part,<note place="margin">The inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> which is the principall efficient cauſe of coction: ſecondly, by thickning of the matter, they make it more rebellious; wherefore wee are to uſe Anodine medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, whereof wee have ſpoken already: you ſhall doe well to apply ſuch a cataplaſme as this. Take of white bread crums jiii ℥, of new milk three quarters of a pinte, of mallow and violet leaves pounded ſmall of each an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: boyle theſe to the conſiſtence of a cataplaſme; then adde to it of ſaffron a dramme, of <hi>unguentum populeum</hi> iij ℥: let the apoſteme bee dreſſed with this, or ſuch a medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, morning and evening.</p>

               <p>You may demand of mee,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> how long the application of theſe topicks preſcribed, for the removing of accidents, are to bee continued.</p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> untill the accident bee almoſt gone, with the which you encountered, and then you may proceed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt nature, by increaſing naturall heat by ripening medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which was the ſecond intention of curing apoſtemes ſet downe by mee.<note place="margin">Maturation of apoſtemes.</note> Now thoſe medicaments which help nature, ought firſt to ſtop the pores reaſonable, only ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the ſharp vapors to breath out, and to detaine thoſe which are mild, and ſomwhat thick, which are the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary cauſe of coction. In this reſpect, then they ought to be viſcous and tough in ſubſtance, ſuch are temperate oyles, and mucilages,<note place="margin">Gal de ſimplic. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>acult.</note> which by <hi>Galen,</hi> are called <hi>Emplaſtica:</hi> ſecondly, they ought to be familiar to nature, and ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately hot and moyſt. One thing is to be noted, that hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſimples are to bee choſen, according to the temperature of the part, if the Tumor ſeeme ſomwhat cold: wherefore if the Tumor ſeeme hot, only maturatives in the firſt degree
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16145:28"/>are to be uſed, and thoſe of the ſecond degree to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: But if the matter be ſomewhat cold, then you are to uſe maturatives of the ſecond, yet alwayes mingling with them ſome of the firſt degree. And the reaſon is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the medicaments of the ſecond degree dry too much, wherefore thoſe of the firſt degree are to be added, in the which there is much moiſture, which is requiſite to coction and producing of quittor. Theſe medicaments are called <hi>Concoquentia,</hi> and <hi>Pus moventia,</hi> and <hi>Suppurantia:</hi> ſuch ought to be hot and moiſt, as the body of a temperate man is, and ſo they ought neither to dry or moiſten, or to heat or coole immoderately, but onely to preſerve and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the naturall heat; for a ſuppurative medicament ought to anſwer the conſtitution of him unto whom it is applied.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Degrees of ſuppurative medicaments.</note>Of theſe ſuppurative medicaments there be two rankes: In the firſt, are Mans-greaſe which aſſwageth paine alſo, Duckes-greaſe, Gooſe-greaſe, Hens-greaſe, oyle of ſweet Almonds, ſweet ſallet Oyle, Mallowes, ſweet Butter, Figs,<note place="margin">Simples of the firſt degree.</note> Fenugreeke, Lilly roots, Linſeed, Wheat-flowre; a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſme made of Wheat-flowre, Water and Oyle, an Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter made of yellow wax, and oyle called <hi>Cerelaeum,</hi> Violet leaves and flowers, ſaffron. For an example,<note place="margin">Compound.</note> I will ſet down the deſcription of a ſuppurative Cataplaſme compounded of ſome of theſe of the firſt rank: Take of Milke a pint, in the which boyle of Wheat-flowre a quartet of a pound, of Violet-leaves, and Mallow-leaves ſtamped, of each a handfull, of Lilly-roots, and Figs boyled in water, untill they be ſoft, of each two ounces; when they are come to the conſiſtence of a Pultice, adde of Saffron beat to powder a dramme, of the oyle of Linſeed, ſweet Almonds, Lillies, and Mans-greaſe, of each one ounce; and ſo make up your medicament. If the Tumor be immoderatly hot, mingle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with your ſuppuratives thoſe things which are cold and moiſt in the firſt degree, as Violet-leaves, Lettice, the pulp of Pompions, Grownfill, Succorie, Dandelion, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16145:29"/>ſuch like. If of a ſudden you be called, and be required to dreſſe a Tumor tending to ſuppuration, you may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Apothecaries ſhop, and with theſe things dreſſe it. Firſt, beat ſome oyle of Violets and faire Spring water, together, taking two ſpoonfull of oyle, and one of water, with the which embrocat the Tumor, then apply a pledget moiſtened in this, upon the part which is like to breake, or be opened; and above the pledget, <hi>Diachylon ſimplex</hi> if the Tumor be hot, or <hi>Diachylon cum gummis</hi> if it be but a little exceeding the ordinary temperament.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Suppuratives of the ſecond degree. Simples.</note>Suppuratives of the ſecond degree are theſe; <hi>Terebinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Ammoniacum, Galbanum ſagapenum, Gummi elemni, Pix navalis,</hi> Burgundie pitch, Saffron, Leaven, Fenugreek, Onyons and Garlicke roſted under the imbers, old Butter, oyle of Camomill, and Dill, old Hens-greaſe, Badgers-greaſe, and Beares and Dogs-greaſe, Wheat-flowre, Flowre of Linſeed.

               </p>
               <p>As before I have done, ſo now I will ſet downe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound medicament, framed of theſe Simples: Take of the roots of the white Lilies, of the roots of the marſh Mallow, of Onyons boyled and bruized, with the liquor of each iiij. ℥. of Leaven ij. ℥. of Linſeedmaeale j. ℥. and a half, of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron beat to powder a dram, of <hi>Ammoniacum</hi> &amp; <hi>Galbanum</hi> diſſolved in Muſcadine, and the pulp of Figs, of each j. ℥. of oyle of Camomill and Lilies ſo much as will make a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſme of a good conſiſtence.</p>
               <p>In Strumes, and <hi>Bubos venereall,</hi> uſe this: take of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chylon cum gummis,</hi> and <hi>Emplaſtrum de muci laginibus,</hi> of each j. ℥. of Garlicke and Onyons roſted under the imbers of each ij. drammes, of <hi>Dialthaea cum gummis,</hi> Mans-greaſe, and Beares-greaſe of each j. dramme, make a medicament. One thing I would have you to note, that ſuppuratives of this degree are fitteſt for all contagious Tumors, and that to all ſuch, Onyons and Garlicke roſted, and mingled with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16145:29"/>other medicaments, are to be applied; for being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared, they leeſe their ſharpneſſe, attract, and become fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the naturall heat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How Apoſtemes are to be opened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto you have heard how that Tumors that cannot be diſcuſſed are brought to ſuppuration: Now I am to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver unto you, how the matter, which is ſuppurated, is to be diſcharged. This is done by opening the part: Now ſome things are to be conſidered before the action, ſome in the action, and ſome after the action: Before we goe about to open an Apoſteme, Firſt, we muſt be certaine whether it be ripe enough; Secondly, we muſt reſolve how to open it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Signes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie.</note>The ſignes of maturation are; I. The Tumor, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting it ſelfe, ſeemeth leſſe than it was in the ſtate; for while the naturall doth concoct the matter, vapours are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the heat, and ſo the part is diſtended; but when the matter is concocted, the elevation of vapours ceaſeth, and the Tumor falleth ſomewhat. II. The Tumor draweth it ſelfe to a point, or prominence; becauſe when nature over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the matter, it draweth it together, and draweth it to the skin. III. Hardneſſe and tenſion are much aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for maturation being procured, many vapours are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, which before ſtretched; and made hard the skin. IV. By preſſing the matter with the finger, wee finde a flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuation, or comming and going of it: but we muſt be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect when a Tumor in a great joynt is offered unto us, as in the knee; for if we preſſe laterall parts of it, a certaine undation will appeare. V. The party feeleth much eaſe in the part; partly, becauſe ſome of the ſharpe vapours are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; partly, becauſe the matter concocted doth make the parts more looſe. VI. The vehement heat ceaſeth; for the Humor being come to maturation, the unnaturall heat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bateth, and the naturall heat reſteth. VII. If the part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed hath changed the colour, and of red is become white, and chiefly in the pointed place. VIII. The ſcarffe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16145:30"/>skin becommeth ſhriveled, and ruffled; and this is a good ſigne, for it ſheweth that unnaturall heat hath left it.</p>

They are three; I. The lancet or inciſion-knife, of the which there be divers formes ſet downe by the ancients: of the which wee will ſpeake, when wee come to diſcourſe of particular operations for the which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. II. Is the cauſticke or pyroticall medicament. III. The actuall cauterie, which we will leave willingly to horſe Leeches, unleſſe we be deſtitute of other meanes: and when we are to make a fontanell, or to ſtay a great flux of bloud, or to dry a carious bone, or to correct a cancerous part after that it is extirpate.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Steele inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>As for ſteele inſtruments, wee are to uſe them, Firſt, Apoſtemes bee in the face, to avoid the filthineſſe of the ſcarre, after the curation. Secondly, in ſmall Tumors: for ſo they will be the ſooner whole.</p>
               <p>As for the Cauſticke medicaments,<note place="margin">Cauſtickes.</note> wee uſe two ſorts of them: the firſt is made of the ſtrongeſt ſope lees, boyled to the conſiſtence of a ſoft ſtone. The ſecond is made of the like lee, and unſlaked lime, boyled to the forme of a firme unguent. The firſt is beſt in Tumors which poſſeſſe the convex part. The ſecond is moſt convenient, if they be in parts concave or hollow.</p>
               <p>Theſe Pyroticall medicaments are moſt fit to be uſed in five caſes: I. If we intend to keep the Tumor long open, as is requiſit in all contagious Tumors, in the plague, &amp; pox: for where the cauſtick is applied, there is alwaies loſſe of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and by it we may make the orifice round, which of all other figures moſt ſlowly is cured. II. In large Apoſtemes cauſticks are fitteſt; for by them, making as large an orifice as we wil, we ſhal ſpare tenting and enlarging of it; beſides, the ſtretched parts will the ſooner bee contracted. III. They are to be uſed in deepe apoſtemations, ſuch as happen in the belly and back, for ſo the matter ſhall have a readier way for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16145:30"/>evacuation. IV. They are beſt, when a flux of bloud may be expected. V. We apply them, when we will gratifie ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Things to be done in the opening.</note>When we are come to open the part, then theſe things are to be obſerved: I. The nature of the part: this teacheth us, to ſhun veines and arteries by reaſon of hemorrage, and nerves, tendons, and membranes by reaſon of the paine which enſueth. II. If the skin only be to be divided, then the apertion is to be made ſtraight; but if a muſcule alſo be to be inciſed, it muſt be done according to the fibres of it. III. Apertion muſt be made in the depending part, becauſe the matter will be more readily ſo drawne out. IV. It muſt be done where the part is thinneſt, for ſo leſſe paine is cauſed. V. The apertion muſt be proportionate; for if it be too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, then the matter, eſpecially if it bee thicke or grumous, cannot be well drawne without expreſſion, which maketh way for calloſity, and fiſtulation. If it be too large, firſt, the ſcar will be the more ugly. Secondly, the parts ſubjacent will be made more apt to be altered, by receiving the impreſſion of the cold aire. VI. Wee are to know how much matter is to bee evacuate at one time: In great Tumors, and thoſe which are in the joynts, great moderation is to bee u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; for with the matter many ſpirits breathe out, and ſo are ſpent: from whence extenuation of the body, yea and death ſometimes enſueth. The Chirurgeon who is to doe this, ought to bee reſolute, chearefull in countenance and ſpeeches, and no wayes ſcrupulous: otherwiſe he ſhall make the Patient diſmayed, and fearefull,<note n="“" place="margin">Gal. <hi>2.</hi> de Sympto cauſ. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> which doth much weaken and abate the courage of the Patient.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Things to bee done after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertion.</note>Things to be obſerved after the opening of an Apoſteme, are theſe: Firſt, the removing of accidents which moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fall out. Secondly, the manner of dreſſing. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents are moſt commonly three, fainting, chiefly if the parties be children, women, but above theſe, effeminate men. Secondly, paine. Thirdly, a flux of bloud.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Againſt fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note>As for fainting, we may labour to prevent it, by mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Dreſſing after opening.</note>As concerning the manner of dreſſing after opening: If this hath beene done by inciſion, either a tent, if it be ſmall, or doſels with pledgets armed with ſome reſtringent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as bole, frankincenſe, and flowre tempered with the whites of egges, if it be large, are to be uſed: and ſo it is to remaine for the ſpace of foure and twenty houres. If the cauſtick be applied, then <hi>Dialthea ſimplex,</hi> or ſweet butter melted in a ſawcer, are fit to be uſed untill the eſchare fall; then the cavity is to bee incarnate: If in the meane time ſpungeous fleſh appeare, it is to be removed with cathereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call medicaments, as ☿ precipitate alone in gentle bodies, or mingled with alome, taking the third patt of this in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bodies: yea, you ſhall be enforced ſomtimes to uſe <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis ſine pari.</hi> &amp; other Fiſtula powders with ſome medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which coole and aſſwageth paine, as <hi>Vnguentum populeum,</hi> and <hi>Roſatum Meſuis:</hi> take my word, <hi>Baſilicum</hi> and <hi>Aureum</hi> are not ſo fit.</p>

               <p>A Phlegmon is a Tumor hot, proceeding from the afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of blood to any part. In this deſcription,<note place="margin">A deſcription of it.</note> where it is ſaid to be hot, in this it is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Oedema</hi> and <hi>Schirrus;</hi> and in this that it is pronounced to proceed from blood, it is ſevered from <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> of cauſed of choler: the differences are taken either from the materiall cauſe of it, or elſe from ſome parts which it poſſeſſeth. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of it taken from the matter are theſe:<note place="margin">Differences from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> It is either <hi>Legitima,</hi> or <hi>Notha,</hi> either truly bred, or elſe baſtardly.</p>
               <p>A proper Phlegmon, is cauſed of good blood, onely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending in quantity: Good blood is diſcerned by colour,<note place="margin">Good blood.</note> taſte, and conſiſtence: In colour it is red, in taſte ſweet, in conſiſtence meane, betweene thicke and thin: of all other humors it is moſt plentifull in the body, becauſe it affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nouriſhment to all the fleſhy parts, as they have their being by it. Next unto blood,<note place="margin">More phlegme than choler or melancholie.</note> there is more of ſweet and alimentarie phlegme, than of choler and melancholy; becauſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16145:32"/>it is bloud halfe concocted, and in extreme hunger nature turneth it unto nouriſhment. But it is not ſo eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of the other two humors, choler and melancholy; <hi>Alex. Aphrodiſaeus</hi> thinketh that there is more choler than melancholy,<note place="margin">a. <hi>2.</hi> problemat.</note> for by reaſon of choler being hot and thin, the bloud being made thin, doth paſſe the more readily, even by the capillar veines, to nouriſh the moſt outward parts: but in truth,<note place="margin">More melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie than choler.</note> and by all likelihood, there is more melancholy than choler, if you take melancholy for the groſeſt part of the bloud: for firſt, ſeeing the bones which by ancient computation are 246. but more in number indeed are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by this humor, it being cold and dry, anſwerable to their temperature, it muſt bee more plentifull than choler. Secondly, becauſe the ſpleene appointed to bee a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of melancholy, is larger than the gall. Thirdly, becauſe choler is not ſo familiar to nature as melancholy is: for as by a ſmall quantity of choler, a great deale of milke becommeth bitter, even ſo it is in blood. Now things bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are unpleaſant to nature; wherefore it is probable, that provident nature hath in the maſſe of bloud appointed more melancholy than choler. Laſtly, if we diligently note bloud drawne out of the veines by phlebotomie, wee ſhall evidently ſee more feculent bloud in the bottome of the the ſawcers, than yellow choler fleeting in the top.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Signes of a true phlegmon.</note>The ſignes of a true Phlegmon are ſix. I. This Tumor beginneth ſuddenly, and encreaſeth ſpeedily, becauſe the matter is plentiful, and the wayes by the which it is ſent very patent and large. II. It is very hot in reſpect of <hi>Oede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> and <hi>Schirrhus,</hi> but yet not ſo burning as <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi> III. The colour of the part is of a freſh ruddy colour. IV. In this Tumor there is great paine with pulſation. V. There is a great tenſion in the part, becauſe the unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat raiſeth plenty of vapours which diſtend the part. VI. The veines which before lay hid become conſpicuous, and appeare either ruddy or blackiſh.</p>

               <p>Theſe inflamations, if they poſſeſſe the externall parts, and be but moderate are healthfull;<note place="margin">Prognoſticks.</note> as thoſe which either by reaſon of the plenty, or malignity of the humor, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a gangren, and mortification are to be ſuſpected. A phlegmon which hapneth in a young body, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> in a hot and thin part, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> the body being not very plethoricke and in the ſummer time is more ſpeedily cured; but quite contrarily if the conditions be oppoſite. The indications curative of a true phlegmon are taken from the times of it: The meanes by the which we cure are two, a convenient diet, and artificiall application of apt meanes for curing of the Tumor.</p>
               <p>In the beginning therefore, we muſt preſcribe ſuch a diet as is able to hinder the increaſe of ſuperfluous blood, and the fluxion of that which is already bred: wherefore the diet muſt be ſpare and ſlender, onely ſufficient to ſuſtaine nature, and withall cooling: the patient then ſhall reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with chicken, and veale broth with bread, calves-feet and trotters ſtewed, and ſeaſoned with vineger, thin oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale-gruell, panadoes, ſallets made of ſorrell, ſpinage, purſelaine boyled in thin chicken or veale broth, ſeaſoned with ſome vineger, verjuice and ſugar; let his drinke bee ſmall beere or ale, altered in the ſummer with barrage, bugloſſe and burner; barley-water, faire ſpring-water, wherein the cruſt of a loafe hath beene boyled, and made
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16145:33"/>pleaſant with <hi>oxie ſaccharum,</hi> or <hi>oximel diureticum,</hi> ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with a pint of the water, one ounce and an halfe of the ſirrups. If the party be weake, Almond-milke made of barley-water, or the thin broth of a chicken may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: If we intend to make the blood unapt to motion, and to detaine it in its owne receptacles, then we muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a diet, having theſe three qualities: For firſt, it muſt coole: Secondly, it muſt make a conſtriction, and purſing up of the veſſels: Thirdly, it muſt be diureticall, or move urin; for much ſeroſity being carried away by the paſſages of urine, the blood muſt be made thicker, and therfore not ſo apt to flow. But we muſt take heed, that ſuch a diet be onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to ſuch as are in their conſtant age, and have large veines; otherwiſe, we ſhall cauſe new obſtructions, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply griefs: now to this purpoſe, you may ordaine broths, wherein lettice, ſorrell, ſpinage, purſelain, marigold-flowers, and columbine-flowers and leaves have beene boyled, calves, ſheeps, and lambs heads boyled, with greene-ſawce made of ſorrell, or alleluia, be ware of alliaria, jacke of the hedge, or thoſe ſimples which are hot, young chickens with gooſeber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-ſawce, are good, and ſuch like. We muſt forbid wine, fleſh, egges, fat things, and ſuch as breed too much blood; and ſpices, becauſe they heat the blood; &amp; piercing drinks, as ſtale beer or ale,<note place="margin">Wardens and peares reſted, ſtewed, or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are good.</note> becauſe they further the fluxion of blood. To procure urine, an almond-milke may be made of a pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan, having the emulſion of the ſeeds of the pompion, gourd, muſck-melon, cucumber, lettice, purſelaine, and plantaine. Now the humor flowing immoderately,<note place="margin">Evacuation.</note> we muſt labour to ſtay by abetting of it, and that by two manner of wayes; by phlebotomie, and purgation.</p>
               <p>As for phlebotomie,<note place="margin">Phlebotomie.</note> if the inflamation be great, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty young and ſtrong, and full of blood; in the ſpring time we may take a lib. at a time, yea more, and iterate it if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion be offered: in others, moderation is to be uſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrength of the patients.<note place="margin">Which veines are to bee opened.</note> If a phlegmon poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the parts which are above the liver, then the veines of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16145:33"/>the armes and upper parts are to be opened: but if it invade the parts which are under the liver, as the kidnies &amp; geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, then the branches of the <hi>vena cava</hi> deſcending are to be opened in the hams or ancles. One thing is to be noted in Phlebotomie; that we open not veines too farre diſtant from the part affected, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ena frontis</hi> in diſeaſes of the feet: for we ſhould evacuate too great a quantity of blood, before wee ſhould intercept any tending to the part affected. If a Phlegmon hath ſucceeded the ſtaying of the evacuation of blood from any part, as from the noſe, the wombe, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhodes, meanes muſt be uſed to procure theſe accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med evacuations: but ſeeing theſe may be found in all who have ſet downe the manner how to cure particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, I will leave them to diligence and induſtrie of your ſelves, being unwilling to miſpend time.</p>
               <p>As for Purgation,<note place="margin">Purgation.</note> one may doubt whether it can doe any good; ſeeing no blood, the matter of a Phlegmon, can be by this meane ſpent. I anſwer, that it helpeth by accident, and two manner of wayes: for firſt, purgation drieth the body, and ſo depriving the blood of moiſture, maketh it more unapt to flow. Secondly, by purging ſharpe humors, the part which ſendeth the humor is not pricked forward. But in this caſe, lenitives are better than eradicatives,<note place="margin">What purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives moſt ſit,</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they rather coole than heat, and cauſe no ebullition in the humors: ſuch are <hi>Diacatholicum, Electuarium leniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum, Electuarium de ſebeſten,</hi> or a bole, or caſſia, tamarinds and ſugar of violets.</p>

Wherefore the hot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the party and part require gentler topicks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the exceſſe is not great, only heat being added to heat; but if the part bee cold, and leſſe fleſhie, it requireth ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger medicaments, becauſe the cauſe muſt bee greater: ſo in children end women wee uſe milder than in aged and ſtrong bodies: ſo the greater the inflamation is, the ſtronger ought the topick to bee: ſo if the part bee very ſenſible, gentle meanes will ſerve; but if it bee dull it will ſuffer ſtronger: ſo if the veines bee large, ſtronger medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be applied; becauſe plenty of blood muſt needs flow. Laſt of all according to the conſtitution of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16145:35"/>aire the locall meanes muſt bee ſtronger or weaker.</p>
               <p>Now it is time to determine, what medicaments are to bee uſed in the beginning of a phlegmon:<note place="margin">Beginning of a phlegmon.</note> If therefore the partie bee offered while the blood is wholly yet in the ſmall veines: then repelling medicaments are to bee applied. I. Becauſe the humor as yet is but little and thin. II. Becauſe nature as yet is ſtrong. III. Becauſe the matter is not as yet ſetled or impacted: If ſome of the humor bee in the ſmall veins, and ſome be without them in the diſtances of the muſculs, and parts, or in the poroſities of the ſimilarie parts, wee are to apply medicaments partly repelling, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcuſſing; but more of the repelling.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, in caſes repelling, medicaments are not to bee applied unto phlegmons beginning. I. If the parts bee weake, left their naturall heat bee quenched: ſuch are glandulous parts, for they are looſe, and flaggie. II. When there is intolerable pain: for then repelling medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would cauſe greater paine, and ſo perhaps cauſe fainting and ſwouning. III. When the cauſe is externall, and cauſeth a malignitie, as the biting of a mad dogge, or of an adder: for ſo the matter ſhould bee driven to the principall parts. IV. When the fluxion is vehement, and much matter floweth: for then repelling medicaments ſhould bee fruitleſſe, the part not being able to reſiſt.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing I have ſet downe both the ſimples, and ſome formes of compounded medicaments of the two kindes of Topicks, I will abſtaine from all idle repetition, and paſſe to to the <hi>augmentum,</hi> or increaſe of a phlegmon.

                  <hi>LECT. VII.</hi> Of an Eryſipelas.</head>
               <p>HAving in my former weekly lecture delivered what I thought pertinent concerning the firſt generall Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, a phlegmon, the cauſe whereof was ſaid to bee blood without the veſſels offending in quantitie or qualitie. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod now warneth mee to diſcourſe of the ſecond generall Tumor called Eryſipelas, proceeding for the moſt part from choler: not ſo much becauſe it ſurpaſſeth either phlegme or melancholie, whereof Oedema and Schirrus are bred, in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16145:37"/>dignity or quantity, as that it more repreſenteth a phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in accidents, to wit, heate and colour.</p>
               <p>But before I enter into a particular diſcourſe of an Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas, give mee leave to touch three points briefly, which will make all things which I ſhall deliver, more plaine. The firſt, is the ſignification of this terme choler: The ſecond ſhall bee of the divers kindes of choler: The third ſhall ſet downe the ſignes of a cholerick perſon: for ſuch an one is moſt ſubject to this Tumor. <hi>Colera</hi> then in Latin, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greeke ſignifieth not the humor, which in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh is called choler or the gall; but a diſeaſe, whereby this humor is expelled vehemently by vomit and ſiege. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe in our vulgar ſpeech, and with the barbarous late writers, it is taken for the humor it ſelfe, and ſo I ſhall bee inforced to uſe it. Thus much I thought to inſinuate to you, that you ſhould not bee ignorant of the proper and learned ſignifications of the termes of Art.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Bilis</hi> or <hi>Fel</hi> in Latine, in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greeke, choler or gall in Engliſh is either alimentarie, or ſuperfluous: the alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie is the fourth part of the maſſe of bloud dry and hot, which more property might bee called bilious bloud: the ſuperfluous, which ſerveth not for the nouriſhing of the body, is either naturall, or unnaturall: the naturall is that, which in the liver is ſeparated from the blood, and turned to <hi>veſicafellis.</hi> The unnaturall comprehendeth foure ſorts. under it. I. is the Vitelline, like unto the yolkes of egges yellow; but thicker and hotter than that of the gall: II. is <hi>Potracea,</hi> which in colour repreſenteth the leeke, it is engendered in the ſtomack by reaſon of cruditie, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch meats as engender it: as gartick, onions, leeks, and milkin Infants, who often by ſeege diſcharge ſuch an humor: III. <hi>Aeruginoſa,</hi> like verdigrece engendred of more vehement heat, and corrupt aliments in the ſtomack: IV. is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, like unto woad; it is more greene, than that which reſembleth the leeke: it is cauſed of the <hi>arugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſa</hi> more burned, and commeth neere to <hi>atrabilis.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:16145:38"/>
               <p>Now, a man is thought to bee of a bilious conſtitution, if hee bee watchfull, nimble, haſtie, angrie, and dreame of fire and thunder, his urine is thin and yellow, his pulſe ſtrong, ſwift, and hard, his veines are large, the habit of his body is leane, and dry, his colour yellowiſh: cold things refreſh him.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being permitted, now I am to diſcourſe of the Tumor Eryſipelas it ſelfe, of it I will ſet downe five things: the Etymon of the word, the nature of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, the ſignes of it, the prognoſticks of it, and laſt of all the indications of curing of it. i. As for the Etymon of the name of this Tumor, it is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is nothing elſe but a Tumor in colour, comming neere to red, and tainting often the adjacent parts: for thin and hot blood, or blood with the which yellow coler is mingled, dyeth the skin with the colour of a pale roſe: the nature of Eryſipelas is diſcovered by ſetting downe the deſcription, and kindes of it.</p>
               <p>An Eryſipelas then is a hot Tumor proceeding from moſt of choler, in this deſcription Tumor is the <hi>genus:</hi> for this is common to Eryſipelas with all other Tumors. In that is ſaid to bee hot, it differeth from Oedema and Schirrus: and whereas it is affirmed to proceed of moſt choler, it is diſtinguiſhed from all the reſt of the Tumors.</p>
               <p>But here it may bee demanded, whether Eryſipelas bee cauſed of alimentarie, or of ſuperfluous choler: unto the which queſtion I anſwer, that it is to bee thought that it is cauſed of the alimentarie choler, if it bee exquiſit: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how could the yellow jaundiſe, and Eryſipelas ſo much differ, if they both did proceed from excrementitious cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: for firſt the yellow jaundiſe poſſeſſeth the skin of the whole body; but Eryſipelas one part only: ſecondly, an Eryſipelas hath alwayes a ſymptomaticall feaver annexed to it; but the yellow jaundiſe is moſt commonly free from it:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16145:38"/>thirdly, in an Eryſipelas there is alwayes paine; but in the jaundiſe none: fourthly, in the jaundiſe the skin is of a yellowiſh colour; but in an Eryſipelas it is of a bright red colour.</p>
               <p>There are two kindes of Eryſipelas, for it is either exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, or not exquiſit, or a true, and a baſtard one: as for an exquiſit Eryſipelas it is a Tumor of a bright red tending to yellow, cauſing little ſwelling, very hot with a pricking paine, cauſed of alimentarie choler: this choler abounding in the body if part of it bee turned into any part, it cauſeth an exquiſit Eryſipelas. The parts which it moſt commonly invadeth, are the noſe and face, for much thin blood flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to theſe parts: ſecondly, the legges: for nature being moved by the plenty of this choler ſendeth it firſt to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctories of the groynes, and from thence it deſcendeth to the legs, it hapneth in the ſommer; becauſe then cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is multiplied; but in the winter, becauſe the pores of the skin are ſhut by cold, and ſo inſenſible perſpiration hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: and becauſe this humor is thin, it ſpreadeth to a great part of the skin.</p>
               <p>As for the ſignes of an exquiſit Eryſipelas, they are either taken from the qualities of the humor which cauſeth it, or from the differences betweene it and a phlegmon. The ſignes taken from the qualities of the humor are theſe: The paine is great and urgent, the heat notable, the colour a bright red tending to a yellowneſſe, the tumor is ſmall, only poſſeſſing the skin, the pulſation is very ſmall, and leſſe than in a phlegmon. Firſt, becauſe the parts in a phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon are more compreſſed, and it reacheth deeper: ſecondly, becauſe in a phlegmon the humor is thicker, and cannot ſo eaſely bee breathed out as in an Eryſipelas. The differences betweene a phlegmon and an Eryſipelas are theſe. I. A phlegmon poſſeſſeth the skin, and the fleſh lying under; but an Eryſipelas the skin only: the cauſe in an Eryſipelas is the thinneſſe of the humor, which rather diſperſeth it ſelfe through the skin than heaveth it up. II. The heat in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16145:39"/>an Eryſipelas is greater than in a Phlegmon: for ſomtimes the <hi>cuticula</hi> is bliſtered. III. The ſymptomaticall feaver is greater in an Eryſipelas, than in a Phlegmon: becauſe choler is hotter than blood. IIII. The paine in an Eryſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas is leſſer; than in a Phlegmon: becauſe in it there is only a hot diſtemperatute; but in this a ſolution of unity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the parts being ſtretched. V. In a Phlegmon, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is of a darke red, by reaſon of thick blood lying deepe; but in an Eryſipelas the colour is a brighter red, tending to a yellownes. VI. In an Eryſipelas there is a pricking paine but in a Phlegmon, a heavie &amp; ſtretching. VII. The skin in an Eryſipelas being preſſed, yeeldeth; but in a Phlegmon it doth not: The cauſes are the thinnes and thicknes of the humor. VIII. In an Eryſipelas the rednes vaniſheth away from the skin, and it becommeth white if it bee preſſe with the ſinger; but in a Phlegmon it doth not ſo. IX. In an Eryſipelas there is no ſtretching of the akin; but in a Phlegmon there is: Laſt of all, a Phlegmon ſetleth it ſelfe in one place; but an Eryſipelas maketh the parts adjacent red by ſpreading. As for the Prognoſticks of an Eryſipelas: I. That which proceedeth from naturall yellow choler is mildeſt: for no vehement ſymptomes ſucceed: and beſides ſeeing it appeareth in outward parts, it is to bee thought that the inner parts are diſcharged of this humor. II, As it is a good ſigne, if an Eryſipelas bee driven to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, ſo it is fearefull, if it returne from the outward to the inward parts.<hi>Aphor.</hi> 25. <hi>ſect</hi> 9. III. An Eryſipelas appearing in the head is mote dangerous, than in other parts: becauſe if the matter paſſe to the meninges, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>phrenitis</hi> or raving, if to the muſcules of the neck, the Squinancie. IV. An Eryſipelas appearing in wounds, ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, fractures and dislocations, is commonly mortall: if it proceed not from the application of too hot locall medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. V. If an Eryſipelas tend to ſuppuration, it is not good: for then the humor muſt bee thicker than ordinarie, and the obſtructions ſtronger, and ſo the ſolid parts are in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16145:39"/>danger to bee corrupted VI. If a bone being bare, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent fleſhie parts bee poſſeſſed with an Eryſipelas, it is ill: for firſt, the body muſt bee troubled with ſharpe humors, ſecondly, fleſh cannot bee reſtored by ſuch blood.</p>
               <p>Now it is time to draw out our forces, to incounter with this griefe: wee are to meete with it with foure kindes of helps, dyet, chirurgeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, internall medicaments, and locall meanes. As for the dyet, our nouriſhment muſt be cooling and moyſtning. Let the patient then care thin chicken broths, altered with the cooling herbs, panadoes, thin oate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale gruell, ſallets of lettice, ſor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the choler bee very thin, the partie may eate freſh fiſh, which live in cleere ſandie, or rockie waters, as trouts, ſmall pickrells, perches, and of ſea fiſhes, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-maps, and ſmelts, hee may eate alſo of the braine of a pig or it petittoes, or trotters with vineger, and ſorrell, let him refraine from all meates which are fat and ſweet: let his drinke bee ſpring-water, boyled with the bottome of a loafe, made pleaſant with ſome <hi>Oxyſacchar.</hi> or the diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led waters of endive, or ſorrell, hee may uſe a plaine ptiſan: <hi>Galen</hi> permitteth the patient to drink as much cold water as hee will, for this cooleth the body, quencheth the thirſt,<note place="margin">Lib <hi>9.</hi> method. c <hi>5.</hi>

In the Summer, let the aire be coole and moyſt, in Winter, let it bee rather hot :for in this ſeaſon an Eryſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas is cauſed of the conſtriction of the pores of the skin, by reaſon of cold: let all perturbations of the minde bee baniſhed, let ſleepe bee procured; for watching drieth the body. But if an Eryſipelas bee in die face, watching is beſt: for immoderate and long ſleepe filleth the head full of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, wherby the griefe is increaſed.</p>
               <p>As for the chirurgicall helps, it may be doubted whither Phlebotomie bee neceſſarie or no, for the deciſion of this doubt, theſe propoſitions ſhall ſerve: I. If an Eryſipelas
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16145:40"/>invade the head, neck, or face, the <hi>Cephalica</hi> alwayes is to bee opened: leſt a <hi>phrenitis</hi> or <hi>angina</hi> enſue. II. In an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſipelas Phlegmonodes wherein blood increaſeth the heat in what part of the body ſoever it bee, a veine is to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. III. In an exquiſit Eryſipelas in other parts of the body wee ought not to draw blood: for firſt, by drawing of blood, the bloud which remaineth, moveth more, and becommeth more ſubtill: Secondly, the ſtay of choler is taken away: Thirdly, by taking away both good and bad blood together, the party is weakned.</p>
               <p>As for the internall medicaments, they ought alwayes to goe before the locall, if yon except two caſes: I. If an Eryſipelas bee procured by an outward cauſe, as a blow: II. If the heat bee vehement, and the Tumor bee far from any principall art. In theſe caſes we may apply a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant cooling and moyſtning, before wee miniſter any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging medicament. If an Eryſipelas appeare in the head or face, wee muſt open a veine, apply the Leeches, miniſter a purging medicament, preſcribe a ſlender dyet, and uſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions by frictions, ventoſes, bliſterings, and vomiting if it appeare in the legs.</p>
               <p>As for locall medicaments, wee muſt looke about us, for if wee apply cold medicaments, the matter may bee repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the braine, from whence Phrenitis may proceed, or to the throate, which may cauſe Angina: If you bee infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the importunitie of the patient, or ſtanders by to apply a locall medicament. <hi>Aetius</hi> counſelleth to apply a Swallowes neſt beat to powder,<note place="margin">

Secondly, that you apply not unctuous and fat medicaments, for Firſt, they moſt eaſily are infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: Secondly, they ſtop the pores.

               <p>The medicaments which are to bee applied to an Eryſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas muſt bee very liquid, actually cold, and often chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: for when then become hot, they will rather offend than profit, if they bee not removed. The laſt thing which I promiſed to ſet downe concerning the locall medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was, how long they were to bee applied: this wee may find out by two ſignes. The firſt is, if the heate be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether abated, or almoſt: the ſecond is, if the skin hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it owne colour. When you perceive theſe two ſignes, you muſt deſiſt from applying cooling topicks, leſt the skin become livid, or black which threaten a gangren, and ſomtimes mortification. If this appeare, what then is to bee done? firſt, a fomentation is to bee uſed, made of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mint, Scordium, Wormwood, Peniroyall, the leſſer Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, and Betonie boyled in a weake lie made of ordinary aſhes: after the part is ſufficiently fomented, you are to apply <hi>Hippocrates</hi> cataplaſme made of Barlie meale, vineger and oyle of Roſes warme: or this, take of the floure of Barlie, Beans, and Vetches of each iiij ℥. of a weak lie iiij. <abbr>lb.</abbr> boyle theſe to the conſiſtence of an emplaſter, then put to it iiij ℥. of Oximel: if the diſcolouring of the part paſſe through the skin, and the part bee immoderately cooled, it will not bee amiſſe to ſcarifie the part which only remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. I am but in a few words to diſcourſe of a baſtard or a ſpurious Eryſipelas: ſuch an one is to bee thought, when with alimentarie choler an other humor doth concur.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing foure other humors may aſſociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to choler, ſo many kindes of a baſtard Eryſipelas may bee accounted. If therefore ſome blood bee mingled with choler predominant, then <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Of that Eryſipelas, which breaketh the skin, there are two kindes, <hi>Herpes miliaris,</hi> and <hi>Herpes exedens: Herpes milia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> is cauſed of a ſalt wateriſh humor mingled with unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſharpe choler: the ſignes of it are theſe.

                  <hi>LECT. VIII.</hi> Of an Oedema.</head>
               <p>IN the ſubſequent diſcourſe, which I am to deliver of an Oedema, the third generall Tumor cauſed of phlegme, I will uſe the ſame method which I did in the doctrine of an Eryſipelas. Firſt then, I will ſet downe what phlegm is. Secondly, the differences of it: and Thirdly, the ſignes of a phlegmaticke perſon: and then I will deliver the doctrine of Oedema, for ſuch an one is moſt ſubject to this Tumor.</p>
               <p>Phlegme then is the fourth part of the maſſe of blood, cold and moiſt: as concerning the ſorts of it, it is either ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary or excrementitious. The naturall, as it is cold and moiſt, ſo it is without any forraine taſte: as oyle and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are accounted ſweete, when as they have no ranke taſte. This humor by the naturall heat increaſed (as in famine) may become blood, and ſerve for the reſtoring of naturall humiditie: it ought rather to bee called pituitous blood, than phlegme.</p>
               <p>Unnaturall phlegme is that which cannot bee turned into aliment: of it there are three kindes. The firſt is <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuita acida,</hi> ſowre phlegme, ſo called from the taſte which it leaveth in the mouth, when it is ſpit out: This is a raw
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16145:42"/>phlegme and bred in the ſtomacke by reaſon of the defect of naturall heat: ſo that being drawn into veins, it hardly can be altered. The ſecond is <hi>pituita ſalſa,</hi> ſalt phlegm, this is cauſed by the admiſtion of thin ſalt moiſture: for of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things as Aloe, and Coloquint, mingle them with thin humors as you will, a ſalt taſte never can bee procured. In ſweat, teares, and urine this taſte is manifeſtly deprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: a very novice in Alchymie is able to make the ſalt of urin, &amp; one laboured to procure a Patent for making ſaltpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of urine, in the time of the laſt Parliament: but I never heard that hee made any; being, as it is likely, deceived by his imagination. The third kinde of unnaturall or excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious phlegme, is <hi>pituita vitrea,</hi> repreſenting in colour and ſubſtance, moulten glaſſe. This is very cold, thicke and tough, and cauſeth great paine,<note place="margin">

               <p>Phlegmaticke perſons are ſlow and ſluggiſh, their ſenſes dull, they are ſleepy, they dreame of waters, raine or ſnowe, they are not eaſely moved to anger, their pulſe is ſoft, ſmall and ſlow: their appetite is not great, they are ſeldome dry, they by the mouth and noſe void many phlegmatick excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: their urine is white or pale, ſometimes thick; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thin, the ſieges often are raw and flegmaticke: the blood by what means ſoever it flow from the body, is petui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous: their body is whitiſh, ſoft and coldiſh, they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to cold and long diſeaſes, as the dropſie, letargie and ſuch like, laſtly they endure faſting well.

               <p>Having ſet downe the deſcription of phlegme, and the differences of it, as alſo the ſignes which diſcover a phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick perſon, I am to diſcourſe of Oedema, or a phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke Tumor, of it I will deliver theſe five points: firſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16145:43"/>the ſignification of the terme Oedema: ſecondly, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of it: thirdly, the prognoſticks of it: fourthly, the indications of curing of it: and laſtly, what Tumors are to be reduced to it. As concerning the terme <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greek, in Latine Oedema, with <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and all other ancients, it is the ſame with <gap reason="foreign">

But with <hi>Galen</hi> and later authors it is taken more ſtrictly for that Tumor which is cauſed of phlegm. Oedema is either exquiſit or not exquiſit: an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit is either primarie or ſymptomaticall: the primarie is cauſed of the naturall phlegme,<note place="margin">Gal. li. de atra bile cap. <hi>5.</hi>

Naturall phlegm is cold &amp; moiſt, thin in conſiſtence, in colour white, in taſte ſweetiſh or inſipid. The ſignes of an exquiſit Oede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma are five. I.

It is cold without heat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the pituitous humor is cold and moiſt. <hi>Avicen</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth this Tumor <hi>Vndimia.</hi> The materiall cauſe then of this Tumor is the pituitous humor redounding in the wholl body. This humor is cauſed either of externall, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſes: the externall cauſes are aire cold and moiſt, phlegmaticke meats, idleneſſe, too much ſleepe, ſtinging of waſpes, and ſuch like: the internall are a cold and moiſt conſtitution of the head, ſtomacke; but chiefly of the liver. This Tumor invadeth not promiſcuouſly all parts; but ſuch as are cold, weake, and looſe, ſuch are the feet and hands, the cods, as in <hi>hernia aquoſa,</hi> the eyelids: and then in them appeareth an outward Tumor looſe, without pain, not altering the colour of them, which being preſſed with
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16145:43"/>the finger quickly yeeldeth and returneth, the matteriall cauſe is a wateriſh humor mingled with flatuoſitie: ſo the heart and liver cannot ſuffer any ſuch Tumor, as neither the kidnies: becauſe theſe parts are firme and hot. As for the preſages, Oedema is a long continuing diſeaſe, becauſe it is cold, and therefore the naturall heat of the parts affected, muſt bee weake. II. It is not very dangerous, becauſe the paine is either none or very ſmall. As concerning the cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is performed either by diet, or internall medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or locall meanes: as for the diet of ſuch as are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to an Oedema, if it proceed from externall cauſes they muſt bee removed: the aire which is to bee choſen muſt bee hot and dry, the foode muſt bee drying: wherefore roaſted meat is better than boyled, fowles and birds which live in dry grounds; are better than water fowles, rabbets, chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and veale are good, mutton is better than lamb, ſwines fleſh and fiſhes are to bee ſhunned, as alſo heads, braines, and feete of beaſts: ſallets of cold herbs are hurtfull, uſe biſcuit bread, or good houſhold bread baked with Aniſe ſeedes, Fennill ſeedes, and Coriander ſeedes. Let the drink bee altered with the raſping of Quajack, <hi>Sarſaparilla, Radix chinae, Saſſafras,</hi> yellow Sanders Cummin ſeedes, Coriander ſeedes, Fennill ſeedes, Aniſe ſeedes, Galingal, Nutmegs, <hi>Calamus aromaticus,</hi> ſome Ginger, Cinamon, Roſemarie and Sage. The drying diet made of theſe, eſpecially in the ſummer time is good: ſweating in this caſe is very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, every other morning after the taking of the diet: faſting is good as alſo watching, ſtudying, and labouring: for all theſe dry the habite of the body.</p>
               <p>If an Oedema poſſeſſe the hands, then walking is good; if the feet, then we are to praeſcribe ſitting and working with the hands. Seeing then an exquiſite diet will not ſerve to ſurpriſe this diſeaſe alone, we are to entertaine purging medicaments for the expugnation of it. We need not to trouble the patient with many preparative medicaments; ſeeing the pituitous humor which cauſeth this diſeaſe is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16145:44"/>thin, wateriſh and in motion; Firſt of all, no medicaments internall are ſo effectuall in this griefe as <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> and ſafe medicaments of antimonie: for, Firſt they diſcharge the ſtomack of crudities by vomiting, and ſo correct the cold and moyſt diſtemperature of it: Secondly they diſpatch the obſtructions of the meſaraical veines and liver: Thirdly they mightily evacuate wateriſh and phlegmatick humors, and ſo correct the diſtemperature of the liver, and kidneyes.</p>
               <p>As for ordinarie internall medicaments, <hi>pilulae de hiera cum agarico acuat,</hi> with a graine of <hi>Elaterium</hi> are good: <hi>diaphaenicon, diacarthamum, diaturbith, pilulae de hermodacly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, de aromatibus, cochiae.</hi> And the pilles of <hi>Galen</hi> made of coloquint <hi>aloe,</hi> and <hi>ſcammonie</hi> with <hi>ſyrupus Auguſtanus.</hi> As for the doſes of theſe medicaments, and how they are to be exhibited I will refer you to thoſe, who have diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled theſe things, chiefly to the practice of <hi>Martinus Rulandus.</hi>

               <p>In the beginning then we are to apply ſuch medicaments as repell, and digeſt: but more digeſting than repelling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the humor is cold: for in the beginning ſome part of the humor is in the ſmall veines, ſome in the pores of the skin; but more in the cavities, and greater veines: towards the ſtate of the griefe we are to uſe digeſting meanes. <hi>Galen</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:16145:44"/>uſeth foure things, I. A rowlar with two ends,<note place="margin">lib. <hi>2.</hi> ad Glauc. <hi>c. 3.</hi> et <hi>14.</hi> n. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod c <hi>4,</hi>
                  </note> ſuch as is uſed in fractures, firſt the rowler muſt bind the Tumor it ſelfe more ſtraightly; but the parts on every ſide adjacent more ſlackly, for ſo the humor is wrung out from the part affected, to the parts adjacent above and below. II. Is a Sponge, but in the uſe of a ſponge we muſt ſee that it cover all the affected part, otherwiſe at the next dreſſing we ſhall ſee that the humor hath flowed to the bare part: in ſteed of a ſponge we may uſe pledgets of hemp-tow; yea and double cloathes. III. Vineger, for it doth conſume phlegme, and becauſe it is ſubtil it peirceth, IV. Some water to moderate the ſharpneſſe of the vinegor: If an Oedema be above ſinews and tendons in a tender bodie leſſe vineger is required. But in hard bodies and in other places more vineger is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: if you mingle ſome allome with the vineger and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the medicament wilbe the more effectuall. <hi>Avicen</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth to apply lime water with the juice of mirtils: but inſtead of the juice we may boyle myrtle berries in lime water.</p>
               <p>If you boyle ſcordium, myrtle berries, ſumach, red roſe flowers dried, calamint, wormewood and penyroyall, in equall quantitie of red aſtringent wine, vineger, tanners wooſe and lime water adding to every pint of the decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtrained 3. drammes of allome, you ſhall have an excellent medicament. You may apply alſo an unguent made of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaked lime, and old ſwines greaſe.</p>
               <p>One thing is to be noted, that the Oedematous part is to be rubbed well with a cloth before the medicaments be applyed, that they may penetrate more eaſily, <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

Fourthly to incarnat it, and laſt of all to procure skinning. And ſeeing I ſpake of theſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16145:45"/>things in the curing of a phlegmon tending to Apoſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will remit you to that diſcourſe, becauſe I diſtruſt not your memories.</p>
               <p>It falleth out many times that an Oedema, is a ſymptome of an other diſeaſe as I have ſaid: but chiefely of the cough of the lungs, dropſie, and cachexia or ill habit of the body, and doth poſſeſſe the legs and hands: Firſt becauſe they are furtheſt from the heart, the wel ſpring of heat: Secondly, becauſe they are framed of cold parts: ſeeing this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cannot be removed, unleſſe the diſeaſe which is the cauſe of it be cured, and ſeeing theſe diſeaſes are for the moſt part mortall, I will ſuffer ſuch as are empyricks, and prodigall of their owne credits, to follow their owne cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to undertake ſuch cures.</p>
               <p>An Oedema is thus engendred: when nature is troubled with phlegme the expelling facultie thruſteth the pituitous humor from the great veſſels to the leſſer, and being kept in by the denſitie and coldneſſe of the skin, is gathered in the muſculous part, and ſo cauſeth this Tumor. Hitherto then I have diſcourſed of an exquiſite Oedema. Now it remaineth that we briefly diſpatch that Oedema which is not exquiſit. This is cauſed when ſome other humor is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the pituitous: if blood then be joyned with it, it cauſeth <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. In all theſe kindes of a not exquiſit Oedema the thin pituitous Tumor muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant. The other humors concurring are found out by their owne proper ſignes which are ſet downe in the diſcourſes of everie principall Tumor, ſo that I ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the time if I ſhould goe about to ſet them downe here. Some things I would have you to note. The firſt is, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie Oedema is cauſed by congeſtion, for it creepeth on by degrees: But that which is Symptomaticall, an accident of other diſeaſes, as tabes, aſthma, cachexia and dropſie is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by fluxion: for it ſuddenly appeareth. The ſecond is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16145:45"/>this: If by reaſon of long keeping bed, either becauſe one hath had a long and lingring diſeaſe, or becauſe he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a hurt in the leg, the feete ſwell and become Oede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matous, when by motion afterward the naturall heat is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, this flatulent phlegme is diſcuſſed, and the Tumor ceaſeth.<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> One thing may be asked why <hi>Galen</hi> affirmeth that the liver may be poſſeſſed with a ſchyrrus, and not Oedema: To this it may be anſwered;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that the liver by its paranchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma or propertie of ſubſtance turneth thin phlegme whereof an exquiſite Oedema is cauſed, into blood; but if it receive any thick phlegme, of that then a ſchirrus, and not Oedema is cauſed. But it is time to adreſſe my ſelfe to ſet downe thoſe Tumors which are referred to an Oedema: of thoſe ſome are encloſed within a cyſtis or a membrane; and ſome have no proper membrane: thoſe which have a proper membrane are in number 3. Atheroma, Steatoma, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liceuris. But it may be doubted from whence this cyſtis,<note place="margin">Dub.</note> membrane, or folliculus doth proceed.<note place="margin">Sol.</note> Undoubtedly it is framed of the teyes of the cutis and membrana carnoſa: for ſeeing the naturall heat cannot concoct the matter of theſe abſceſſes, nature doth providently ſeparate it by its proper cyſtis from the parts adjacent leſt it ſhould corrupt them.</p>
               <p>The matter which cauſeth theſe abſceſſes and feedeth them, proceedeth from a veine, which is not accompanied with an arterie, and ſo being deſtitute of vitall heat, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unnaturall, and cannot be aſſimilat to the parts unto which it floweth. Atheroma then containeth a ſubſtance like unto rice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pottage, or curds: the matter of this Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is thick and groſſe phlegme.</p>
               <p>Steatoma is a Tumor not ſo high as Atheroma, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a matter like unto greaſe, or that which we call the ſweet bread pancreas: blood flowing by the veine which hath no arterie, and ſo is deſtitute of vitall heat is eaſily turned into this fattie ſubſtance. <hi>Meliceris</hi> containeth a matter repreſenting honey: ſo the phlegme which cauſeth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16145:46"/>this Tumor is thinner, than that which breedeth an athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roma, and hath ſome choler mingled with it the heat whereof maketh the matter fluid, and liquid.</p>
               <p>The Tumors reducible to Oedema which have no cyſtis, are three, <hi>pſydracium, ficus,</hi> and <hi>talpa. Pſydracium</hi> is a pointed white puſtale containing in it a wateriſh humiditie. <hi>Ficus</hi> is a Tumor ſo called, Firſt becauſe it hath a roote like unto a fig: Secondly becauſe it containeth ſmall graines as a fig hath. It is a Tumor red, round, and ſomewhat hard and painfull; from whence iſſueth a matter, like unto the ſeedes of a fig, if it be broken and wrung. The matter of this Tumor is groſſe blood, mingled with phlegme and ſome wateriſh moyſture. <hi>Talpa</hi> or <hi>teſtudo</hi> is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as a mole heaveth up the ground, ſo this Tumor the skin from pericranium, this Tumor is larger than <hi>ſicus,</hi> and is cauſed of more groſſe humors; wherein there is little moyſture.</p>
               <p>So you have a briefe deſcription of the Tumors which are reducible to Oedema: As for the cure of them I will reſerve it untill I come to that part of chyrurgerie called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſheweth how ſuperfluities of the bodie are to be taken away. The moderne authors adde to theſe <hi>Nata,</hi> which is a large Tumor ſo called; becauſe it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth the buttocks called <hi>nates,</hi> without paine, conſiſting of ſoft and pituitous fleſh; cauſed of congeſtion of pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous blood: it is ſeated moſt commonly in the neck, ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and back: it is onely cured by exciſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ganglium</hi> and <hi>lupia</hi> are round Tumors of the nervous parts without paine: yet they differ; for <hi>Ganglium</hi> is hard, but <hi>Lupia</hi> ſoft: 2 <hi>Lupia</hi> may be moved every way, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, downeward, and ſide wayes: but <hi>ganglium</hi> toward the ſides only. Thirdly <hi>Ganglium</hi> is like to a knot of the ſinew; but <hi>Lupia</hi> poſſeſſeth not the ſinewie parts only, but other ſolid and hard-parts in hands and feet.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Signes of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke perſon.</note>Now theſe ſignes diſcover melancholie perſons; they are ſilent, penſive, conſtant in ther purpoſes, ſlow to anger; but if they entertaine it, they turne it unto hatred: their ſleepe is troubleſome by reaſon of fearefull dreames, as of black things, dead bodies, death: they are ſad and given to feare, without cauſe; their puls is ſmall, ſlow and hard: their colour is dark, their apetite to meat and <hi>

So you have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of melancholie, the divers ſorts of it, and the markes of a melancholicke perſon: which things ſhew no ſmall light to attaine to the knowledge of a Schirrus. In my diſcourſe of a Schirrus, I will ſet downe firſt the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Schirrus: Secondly the ſignes of it: Thirdly the differences betweene it and other Tumors: Fourthly the kinds of it: Fifthly, the prognoſticks of it, and laſtly the manner of curing of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Schir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</note>To begin then with the deſcription of a Schirrus, it is a Tumor hard, and without paine, cauſed either of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall melancholy, or thicke, tough, and cold phlegme.

               <p>Now there are foure cauſes of hardneſſe: the firſt is coldneſſe, as appeareth in Ice; this is removed by moderate heat, as by the ſunne. The ſecond cauſe, is dryneſſe, as wee may plainly ſee in the hands of Sailers, and Felt-makers. The third cauſe, too great repletion, which doth appeare in the ſtomacks of gluttons.

As for coldneſſe, it may bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced either by things externall, as cold aire, and narcoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call medicaments: ſecondly, from the part affected,<note place="margin">Becauſe thoſe parts are very thicke. 2. <hi>in.

                  </note> for ſchirroſities chiefly appeare in the beginnings of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, ligaments, and tendons, and other cold parts: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the humor: ſo the melancholick juyce, and thicke and viſcous phlegme: the materiall cauſes of a Schirrus are very cold.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſigne of a Schirrus is, that it is without pain: and this commeth to paſſe, either becauſe the animall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cannot paſſe through an humor ſo thick and glutinous, as that is which cauſeth a Schirrus, or becauſe it is benummed by the coldneſſe of the humor. This is the third ſigne, that it is fixt, and as it were nayled to the part, and doth not move by puſhing, as <hi>Scrophula</hi> or <hi>Ganglium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I will ſhew you how it differeth from other Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. It differeth from a phlegmon, for in this, there is great paine: from Eryſipelas, becauſe this is not hard: from an Oedema, becauſe this yeeldeth to the touch, and leaveth a pit. It is diſcerned from watriſh and flatuous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, becauſe they have a thinner, and more cleere matter. The differences betweene it and a cancer are theſe. I. A cancer is alwayes painfull, becauſe it is cauſed of <hi>bilis atra,</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:16145:48"/>or a duſt choler; but a Schirrus is without paine. II. A Schirrus is cold, but a cancer hot: this is cauſed by reaſon of the humors whereof they are bred. III. A Schirrus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadeth the ſollid and hard parts, as the joynts, tendens and ligaments; but a cancer the looſe and flaggie parts, as the breaſts, the privie parts, and ſuch like. IV. In a cancer, not in a Schirrus, the veines appeare full of a blacke humor: which for the likeneſſe, one may call the legs of the crabbe, as the round Tumor the crabbe it ſelfe. It is high time to ſet downe the predictions of the ſucceſſe of curing, which ſchirroſities are like to have, that when ſuch Tumors are offered to you to bee cured, you may bee made circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and wary in taking of them in hand: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> an exquiſite Schirrus is uncurable, for ſeeing it is ſenſeleſſe, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the part is deprived of the influence of the animall ſpirit; and ſeeing this humor doth diſtend the ſinewes, veins, and arteries, the facultie it ſelfe is ſtrangled and choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſo that it neither can direct, nor help the naturall heat to concurre with the meanes, to bee applied for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching of this griefe. Secondly, this being a cold Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and the naturall heat extremely weake, what hope can there bee, that it can at any time triumph over ſo great an infirmitie. A Schirrus not exquiſit, although it bee not mortall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> unleſſe it bee very great, yet it hardly admitteth any cure, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and by much difficultie. A Schirrus which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hard is altogether uncurable: for gentle means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile nothing, and thoſe which are ſtrong make it more hard: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> a Schirrus from <hi>ſuccus melancholicus</hi> is warely to bee delt withall: becauſe it hath a great affinitie with a cancer, and ſo may degenerate into it, if improper medicaments be applied. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If a Schirrus bee cauſed of thicke and glutinons phlegme, you may be the more bold: for this cannot eaſely contract any malignitie. The differences and divers ſorts of a Schirrus are to enſue: a Schirrus then is either prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or Epigenematicall. A primarie Schirrus is that, which is a griefe of it ſelfe, and not cauſed by reaſon of any infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16145:48"/>preceding. This is twofold, for it is either exquiſit or not exquiſit: a primarie exquiſit Schirrus is that which at the firſt, is cauſed by collection of the melancholie juyce in a part. A Schirrus is thought to bee not exquiſit, when an other humor is joyned with melancholie. If therefore ſome laudable blood bee joyned with it, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Schirrus phlegmonodes, if choler, Schirrus eryſipela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>todes: if phlegme Schirrus oedematodes. Nevertheleſſe, ſeeing theſe are compound Tumors, and are to bee dealt withall according to the doctrine delivered of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Tumors, whereof they are bred: I will leave theſe to your owne conſiderations.</p>
               <p>A Schirrus epigenematicall or Symptomaticall is that, which enſueth after an other Tumor, not handled accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to art, as a phlegmon or an Eryſipelas: this happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth two manner of wayes. I. It may fall out by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate uſe of locall medicaments too cold, and narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall or ſtupefactive: for theſe condenſe, and as it were congeale the humor. Secondly, this may happen by the too continuall application of reſolutive topicks: for ſo only the ſubtill and thin parts are breathed out, and the thick and glutinous remaine. The laſt point, which in the beginning I promiſed to deliver unto you concerning a Schirrus, was the manner of curing of it, receive it then, which I hope you will well like of.</p>
               <p>The indications of curing are taken from three things, to wit the diet, internall medicaments and externall applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As for phlebotomie it is here fruitles, becauſe the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is cold, unles the veins be very full, the blood black, and age and ſtrength conſpire: for then it is expedient, for ſo the humors in the maſſe of blood will bee more fluxible; and the quantitie being diminiſhed, the naturall heat will the more eaſelie rule the reſidue. If a Schirrus bee cauſed in a man by reaſon of the hemorrhods ſtopped, then the lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are to bee applied, if in a woman by reaſon of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrues ſuppreſt, then Saphena is to bee opened.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:16145:49"/>
               <p>As for the diet then, the meat muſt bee of eaſie digeſtion, moiſtning, and affording a thin juyce: ſuch are Chickens, young Pigeons and mountaine fowle, Lamb, Veale, young Pullets and Cockrells, fed Rabbets, poched Egs, aſparagus ſallet, Spinage, Burrage, Purſelaine: bread of good wheat not too much leavened is convenient, let the drinke bee ſmall white wine, or reaſonable ſtrong beere well boyled, cleere, and neither too old, nor too new, good Syder alſo with Roſemarie, Burrage, Bugloſſe burned, and Suger is good. Meats which afford a groſſe juyce are to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as old beefe, all meats dried in the ſmoake, veniſon, fiſh living in muddie waters, all ſalt meats, courſe bread: the immoderate uſe of v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>neger is hurtfull: apple tarts, and warden and peare pyes baked with Fennill-ſeeds and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe-ſeeds will ſerve inſtead of other ſweet meats. Let the habitation of the diſeaſed partie bee in a pure, hot and moiſt aire: too much ſleepe, idleneſſe, griefe and penſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are to bee ſhunned. As for internall medicaments, they ought to purge melancholy, and thick and glutinous phlegme: but both of theſe are to bee prepared before they bee evacuate. Thoſe medicaments which prepare melancholie ought to attenuate or make thin, and moiſten: ſuch are the ſyrups of the juyce of Burrage, Bugloſſe, the ſy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ups of Fumiterry, Hops, and Apples, with the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Balme, Harts-tongue, Scolopendria, Tamariske, and ſuch like. Thoſe medicaments which prepare phlegme ought to bee of an attenuating, and mundifying qualitie, as the ſyrup of Iſope, of Betonie, of Stechas, Oxymel, and Mel roſatum in the decoction of Calamint, Hore-hound, Penny-royall, and ſuch like. The humors being prepared, then they are to bee purged: melancholy is to bee purged with confectio Hamech, Electuarium, Indum, pils de lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de lazuli, the extract of black Ellebor, Electuarium leniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum, and the like, which may bee miniſtred in the infuſion of Sena-leaves and Polypodie. Phlegme is to bee purged with Diaphaenicum, Diacarthamum, Hiera Pachii, Pilulae
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:16145:49"/>
                  <hi>de agarico, et hermodactilis, diaturbith</hi> and the like. The electuaries are to be miniſtred in a decoction of thoſe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which prepare phlegme.</p>
               <p>One thing is to be noted, that nothing is more effectuall in diſcuſſing theſe ſchirroſities, than the continuall taking of the decoction of <hi>ſarſa parilla,</hi> and <hi>guajack</hi> inſtead of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drink, uſing a convenient diet, and procuring everie other morning ſweating: for <hi>lignum vitae</hi> warmeth, and <hi>ſarſa</hi> diſſolveth the hardneſſe: if it performe this in nodes, which are farre harder than any Schirrus poſſibly can be; why ſhould it not performe this office in a Schirrus?</p>
               <p>Here it is no wonder if few be cured: for ſundrie are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient if their expectation be not ſpeedily anſwered, and beſides this, they are unwilling to gaine the loſſe of their health by forgoing their ſenſualitie and pleaſure, being <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris mancipia;</hi> more carefull of their taſt than health.</p>
               <p>But time calleth us to ſpeak of externall applications, which are fit to be uſed in the cure of a ſchirrus. In theſe you are to conſider three things, their faculties, their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and the right uſe of them. As for the faculties then of the locall medicaments they ought to be diſcuſſing and ſoftning, <hi>emollientia</hi> and <hi>diſcutientia.</hi> Repelling medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not to be uſed, becauſe the humor is thick, and hard, and ſo unapt to motion.</p>
               <p>Of emollient medicaments there are foure degrees: in the firſt are thoſe which are gentleſt; ſuch are mans greaſe, capons greaſe, the marrow of harts, and calves bones, ducks greaſe, ſwines greaſe, ſweet butter.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Galen</hi> adviſeth to apply to gentle Schirroſities, a medicament made of ſweet butter, black roſin, and new wax, <hi>Dialthea ſimplex,</hi> is of this degree. In the ſecond degree are theſe, gooſe greaſe, badgers greaſe, dogs greaſe, old ranck oyle, oyle of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed. In the third degree, are the fat of lions, beares, wolves, foxes, libards, and the marrow of horſes, and mans bones. In the fourth degree, are <hi>Ammoniacum, galbanum, bdellium, caranna, tacamahaca, opopanax,</hi> of theſe ſimples you may
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16145:50"/>frame unto your ſelves ſuch compoſitions as the qualitie of the ſchirrus,<note place="margin">

               <p>The deſcription may thus be framed, take of bdellium, ammoniacum, and galbanum, of each 1. ounce, diſſolve theſe in a hot martar with oyle of lilies, adde of the muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage or pulpe of roſted figs ij. ℥, of the mucilage of Linſeed and Fenugreeke, vj. ℥, make up a cataplaſme, dreſſe the ſchirrus with this cataplaſme once a day. <hi>Diachilon cum gummis,</hi> and <hi>emplaſtrum de mucilaginibus</hi> are convenient. <hi>Riolan</hi> the father commendeth this medicament, take of <hi>unguentum de althaea,</hi> of <hi>diachylon cum gummis &amp; emplaſtru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de mucilaginibus</hi> of each 1. ounce, of the oyle of Lilies vj. drammes: mingle theſe well together, you may adde to theſe medicaments ſome vineger to help penetration. If a Schirrus be above a nerve or a tendon, inſtead of vineger you may uſe the ſpirit of wine.</p>
               <p>One thing is to be obſerved, that before you apply any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament, the part affected is to be fomented with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Mallowes, marſh-mallowes, Camomill, Melilot, and Cowſlip flowers in vineger, unto which after it is boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſome ſpirit of wine is to be added.</p>
               <p>As concerning the right uſe of the locall meanes, theſe obſervations following are worth the noting, the firſt is, If a Schirrus be cauſed of the melancholie humor which is cold, thick, and drie, you are to apply a medicament which warmeth, attenuateth, and moyſteneth, II. If the Schirrus be engendred of cold, thick, and tough phlegme, then the medicament ought to be warming, attenuating, cutting, and mundifying. III. Tender perſons and parts require milder; but partes and perſons harder and ſtronger, require more forcible meanes. IV. If a Schirrus hath beene procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe an unskilfull perſon hath applyed medicaments too much repelling, or diſcuſſing to an inflamation: then apply this mollifying liniment. take of yellow wax, and

If immoderate uſe of drying topick hath procured hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then medicaments moyſtning are to be uſed: ſuch is a catapſalme made of mallowes boyled and capons greaſe, or ſwines greaſe.</p>
               <p>Unto a Schirrus theſe tumors may be referred ſtrumae, wartes, cornes, leproſie. As for Strumae and the leproſie, they will require ſeverall tractats.</p>
               <p>Wartes, if the root be ſmall and the top broad, may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by ligature; if the root be broad they muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpate with medicaments.

               <p>Nevertheleſſe ſeeing aqueous or waterie and flatuous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are often preſented to you to be cured, I thinke it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to diſcourſe of theſe, that the doctrine of Tumors may be compleat.</p>
               <p>Firſt then I will diſcourſe of the Aqueous, and then of the flatuous Tumor. The materiall cauſe of the Aqueous Tumor by the Phyſitians is called <hi>ſerum</hi> or <hi>ſeroſus humor.</hi> Of this humor there is but a ſmall quantitie in a healthfull perſon; no more than is fit to make the blood thin, that it may be the more readily caried unto all the parts of the body to afford them nouriſhment.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I addreſſed my ſelfe to diſcourſe of any particular matter belonging to the courſe of Chirurgerie, I allotted in my firſt Lecture, foure parts to Chirurgerie: whereof the firſt was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which teacheth to unite parts disjoyned.<note place="margin">The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unity.</note> Solution of unity I made two fold: either intelligible, to bee apprehended by reaſon or underſtanding, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, which may be perceived by the very ſenſes. The intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible I named a Tumor, in the which very often no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of unity doth offer it ſelfe, either to the ſight or
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16145:57"/>touch, as in many cholericke Tumors, and others in their beginning. Senſible ſolution of unity, I affirmed either to be in the ſoft parts, or in hard. As for the ſolution of unity in the ſoft parts, I appointed two differences of it; to wit, <hi>Vlcus</hi> and <hi>Vulnus,</hi> and ulcer and a wound.</p>
               <p>But here,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> not without a cauſe, a queſtion may be moved, which of thoſe two, in methodicall proceeding, ought to have precedencie. It is an undoubted truth, that the firſt man that loſt his life was <hi>Abel,</hi> and that by wounds; ſo that by all likelihood, men firſt of all bent their wits to finde out meanes to cure hurts received by externall violence: for the neerer they lived to the creation, the more pure their bodies were, no hereditary diſeaſes being left by parents, if you except mortality by reaſon of old age, which no man could eſcape by reaſon of the ſentence of death pronounced for the ſinne of diſobedience againſt <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by Gods owne mouth: and ſo being little troubled with either inward griefes, or outward ſores, they troubled not themſelves about the invention of medicaments to cure theſe; ſo that by the right of time, the treating of wounds ought to precede the handling of ulcers.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Nevertheleſſe, in our times my opinion is, that the diſcourſe of ulcers, for ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reaſons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ought to goe before. For firſt of all, an ulcer doth proceed from an inward Humor corroding, but a wound from an outward inſtrument dividing: ſo that a ſilly Empirick, yea a doting old woman, may go about the curing of wounds in fleſhie parts, and compaſſe it; but to the cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ulcers, the knowledge of Humors, and the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bodies affected are required, which require a man well verſed in that part of Phyſicke called Phyſiologia. Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> greater variety of medicaments is required in the curing of ulcers, than there is in the curing of wounds, &amp; ſo ſtill greater skill is required in the curing of the one than of the other. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, greater eſtimation doth acrew unto thoſe who take upon them the curing of ulcers, than unto thoſe who deale with wounds, and that by all ſorts and degrees
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16145:57"/>of perſons, whether they be rich or poore, rude or civill, learned or Ideots; ſo that I need not to retract my opinion in aſcribing unto the tractation of ulcers the precedencie, before the diſcourſe of wounds.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The ſcope.</note>In my proceeding, I will handle theſe ten points: Firſt, I will point out the Authors who have written laudably of this ſubject. II.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Now are wee to deſcend to the definition of an ulcer, which was the ſecond point:<note place="margin">Point.</note> I will not ſtand upon the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe of ſundry deſcriptions of ſundry Authors, and the examination of them, becauſe this labour would take up too much time, and little edifie you, which was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the end and ſcope of theſe Lectures. An ulcer in Engliſh is deriued from the Latine <hi>ulcus,</hi> and this from the Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe it disjoyneth the part which it poſſeſſeth, and ſo this tearme, in its generall ſignification, comprehendeth every ſolution of unity: and ſo <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> in his Treatiſe concerning wounds of the head doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title it.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:16145:59"/>
               <p>But ſeeing ſolution of unity may proceed from two cauſes, to wit, an externall inſtrument dividing, and a ſharpe humor eroding,<note place="margin">De cauſ morb. cap. ult.</note> according to <hi>Galen:</hi> there muſt be two differences of ſolution of unity likewiſe according to the ſame Author, <hi>de conſtit. art. c.</hi> 6. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulnus,</hi> a wound, procured by an externall inſtrument, and <hi>ulcus,</hi> an ulcer, cauſed of an inward cauſe eroding. Thus then an ulcer is to be deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: It is a ſolution of unity proceeding from an inward cauſe eroding the part.<note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The ſubject of an ulcer, I make not onely the fleſhy part, (whereby I underſtand, not onely all the parts which cover the bones) but the bone it ſelfe alſo.

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which properly ſignifieth the little worme which pierceth wood, and conſumeth it. I ſee no reaſon why the name of an ulcer may not be aſcribed to the ſolution of unity in a bone, if it proceed from an inward cauſe eroding, as the terme of a wound is, if it bee divided by an externall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, as a ſword or hatchet. An ulcer then is a compound diſeaſe: for in it there is both ſolution of continuity, and loſſe of ſubſtance.</p>

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> As for <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> the ſpeculation of it doth belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Or laſtly the diſtemperature of the part it ſelfe.</note>

While any of the three humors (bloud being excepted) in the maſſe of bloud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the veines, is faulty and peccant in quality, it is accounted the cauſe antecedent of an ulcer. Somtimes theſe humors are ſolitary, ſomtimes they are aſſociate together.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 
                  <hi>Contagium,</hi> or infection, it is communicated ſometimes by a rotten and corroding vapour, and ſo very often, if one viſit often one having <hi>Pthyſis,</hi> ſuch vapours being mingled with the aire, infect the party who viſiteth, eſpecially if he draw too neere to the diſeaſed party. So ulcers of the yard come from dealing with women whoſe ſecret parts are tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with venereall ulcers: yea the itch it ſelfe, and ſcabbed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is gotten by either lying with one troubled with it, or ſleeping in a bed where a ſcabbed perſon hath reſted.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> As for the diſtemperature of the part, it may be procured either by cold, as appeareth in kibes, or by heat, as we may ſee in a gangren; becauſe the bloud flowing copiouſly to the part pained, and not being concocted, it putrifieth and erodeth the part. Laſt of all, by biting or ſtinging, as of a mad dog, or a venomous ſerpent, a corruption of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors may be cauſed, the conjunct cauſe of an ulcer: ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very humor that is changed from it owne naturall tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whether it be by putrefaction, aduſtion, or commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing unnaturall, may procure an ulcer in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever part it ſeateth it ſelfe.</p>

The Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſts, make the three humors of the maſſe of bloud, to wit, choler, flegme, and melancholy, to be the cauſes both antecedent and conjunct of all ulcers, if they become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature. So they will have rheumaticke ulcers to be cauſed of ſalt flegme, <hi>Herpis exedens</hi> to be cauſed of erugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous choler; cancerous ulcers of <hi>Bilis atra,</hi> which are the worſt and moſt deplorable of all others.</p>

Wherefore <hi>Bertinus</hi> is his third booke and eleventh of his Phyſicke, doth raſhly and inconſiderately affirme, that not one whit of mercurie, ſalt or ſulphure, lieth hid in the body; for in the itch, ſcabbineſſe, ſome catarrhes, inflammations of the eyes, and fretting ulcers it may be perceived; but in urine, which is alſo an excrementitious humor, the ſalt may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, &amp; preſented to the ſight: yea, beſides the ſalt in urine, another ſubſtance the cauſe of diſeaſes may be marked: for if you take a cleare urine, and ſuffer it to ſettle, a matter like unto the powder of bricke, and ſometimes a white muddie ſubſtance will ſo cleave to the ſides of the chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot or urinall, that it can hardly be ſometimes waſhed away; of ſuch a matter tophes in gouty perſons, and ſtones in the bladder, are ingendred.</p>

Why is <hi>Atrabilis</hi> comprehended under melancholy, ſeeing it is very hot, but this cold?

Before this doubt be ſolved, ſome propoſitions are to be permitted. I. In the Chylus there are two ſubſtances, one liquid and thin, the other thick and terreſtriall, which can no more nouriſh than aſhes. II. Nature doth mingle theſe which are not ſent away by ſtoole, with part of the aqueous and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous humidity cauſed of drink and liquid meats. So in a lie the falt and ſome aduſt parts are ſo mingled, that they are not diſcerned before ſeparation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That the ſpleene draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuperfluous melancholy.</note>I ſay then, that this thick and feculent humor tempered with much moiſture, is to be accounted the ſuperfluous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy humor, and that it is attracted by the ſpleene. For firt, ſeeing this feculent humor is altogetherunapt to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, it muſt be ſeparate from the Chylus, which cannot bee performed by any other part befides the ſpleene. Secondly,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16145:62"/>the ſpleene is of a darker red colour than the liver is, which proceedeth from the thick, feculent, and terreſtriall humor which it imbibeth. Thirdily, <hi>Hippocrates de aere, aq. &amp; loc.</hi> affirmeth, that ſuch perſons as dwell in fenny places are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to paſſions of the ſpleene. The cauſe is, becauſe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not pure, but muddie. Fourthly, if the ſpleene did draw onely thin and wateriſh humors, it could not bee ſo ſubject to obſtructions as it is. The feculent humor mixed with much humidity, is the cauſe of ſundry diſeaſes: the thin part ſometimes aſcendeth to the upper parts, the groſſe to the lower parts of the body, as wee ſee in the ſcurvie, wherein the gummes are ulcerated, and the legs tumifie. The ſpleene being ſpungeous draweth much humidity to it, wherefore ſpleenetick perſons ought to drink ſparingly, for if they bib too much, the naturall heat of the part is eaſily oppreſſed,<note place="margin">The qualities of the wateriſh Humor of the ſpleene.</note> and ſo they become hydropick. The wateriſh hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the ſpleene is not inſipid, but ſharpe and biting, and copious: ſo we ſee thoſe who are troubled with quartanes, about the end of each fit to ſweat plentifully; and thoſe who are oppreſſed with melancholy to ſpit much. In the thick, feculent, &amp; terreſtriall blackiſh matter, ſomtimes there is no exceſſe of the ſpleene: in qualities, ſometimes there is, and thoſe are two: <hi>Acerbitas,</hi> an aſtringent ſharpneſſe, ſuch as appeareth in greene unripe fruits; and <hi>Aciditas,</hi> ſowrneſſe: from theſe qualities intended and exalted, <hi>atra bilis</hi> becommeth ſo corroſive. So much I thought good to ſet downe of melancholy, to cleare the doubts which are moved of it, and to ſhew one uſe of the ſpleene.</p>
               <p>To returne then to the carbonary crue of unlearned Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſts,<note place="margin">Object.</note> They object thus, The rationall Phyſicians af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the body to be nouriſhed by the foure humors, how can they then be cauſes of the diſeaſes?</p>
               <p>It is ſtrange that any men ſhould wilfully ſhut the eye of the mind,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> underſtanding I meane, that they may not ſee the truth, ſeeing man, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the very firſt words of the booke of his Metaphyſicks affirmeth, naturally coveteth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16145:62"/>knowledge, and witneſſes are our firſt parents to their owne and our loſſe. No dogmaticall Phyſician ever affirmed any diſeaſe to be cauſed of any humor of the body, as long as it continueth in its owne naturall eſtate; but then to ſtir up griefes, when it is ſeparate from the reſt, when it doth putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, when forraigne ſubſtances and qualities are added, which make it of a familiar humor, a proſeſſed enemy to health, conſiſting of the natural conſtitution of the body, reſulting of the laudable commixtion of the foure humors naturall. I have inſiſted ſomwhat long in the ſetting down of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ulcers, becauſe he (whoſoever he be) that goeth about to cure ulcers without the knowledge of the cauſes, is like one, who being blindfolded, is ſet to thraſh a cocke.</p>

               <p>OF the ten Points, within the limits of which I reſolved to include all my diſcourſes of ulcers, in my former Lecture I diſpatched three; in the firſt I nominated the prime Authors, who have written of this ſubject: in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, I ſet downe the deſcription of an ulcer: in the third, I diſcourſed ſomewhat largely of the cauſes of ulcers in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
               <p>Now the fourth Point, concerning the differences,<note place="margin">IV. Point.</note> and ſundry ſorts of ulcers, offereth it ſelfe to be handled, and in truth the courſe of nature ſo requireth: for the forme of every particular ulcer doth ſpring from the cauſe conjunct of the ſame: for example, a cancer ulcerate is diſcerned from all other ulcers by its proper and pathognomonicall ſignes, all which as effects, are aſcribed to <hi>Atra bilis,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted in the part the cauſe conjunct of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Here of purpoſe I omit the idle and fruitleſſe diſtinctions of ulcers,<note place="margin">Differences of uncers.</note> ſet downe by ſundry Authors, which neither bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

From their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</note> which are matteriall. The matteriall differences then of ulcers are taken either from the nature or conſtitution of an ulcer, or from the ſubject or part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. From the nature and conſtitution, an ulcer is either ſimple or compounded.</p>
               <p>In a ſimple ulcer, nothing is offered which may ſtay the Chirurgeon from going about the conſolidation of it, as the cauſe conjunct, a cruell ſymptome, adjuncts, or ſome diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Differences of a compound ulcer.</note>A compound ulcer wherein either ſome of theſe, or all are found, which muſt be removed before unition be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is either of the milder ſort, or maligne.</p>
               <p>The more milder ſort of ulcers yeeld to ordinary and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all medicaments, if they be judiciouſly applied.</p>
               <p>The maligne yeeld not, and beſides have fearefull ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes: thoſe maligne ulcers proceed either from inward, or outward cauſes.</p>
               <p>From internall cauſes ſpring a cancer ulcerate, <hi>Phageda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Nome,</hi> fretting ulcers, and others which are called <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronia,</hi> or <hi>Telephia,</hi> which denominations inſinuate nothing unto us concerning the nature or curation of an ulcer, but bring onely unto our memory the names of theſe who are celebrated by Poets, which belong more to Grammarians than Phyſicians or Chirurgeons to be knowne.</p>
               <p>The externall cauſes which procure ulcers are two, to wit, <hi>Contagium,</hi> contagion, or a venomous quatity, vapour, or humor, comprehended under the name of <hi>Venenum,</hi> or poiſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">II.

Other differences are taken from the continuance, figure and quantity, are here impertinent, and further only predictions, of the which I will ſpeake in the prognoſticks of ulcers.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">V. The ſignes of ulcers.</note>As concerning the ſignes of ulcers, an internall ulcer is found out and diſcerned by the excretion or matter expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. As for example, if the urine be purulent we conjecture the kidneyes or bladder to be ulcerate.<note place="margin">Signes of the lungs ulcerated</note> If purulent matter be voided by coughing, it is like that the lungs are ulcerate; if much of ſuch matter be rejected, and ſignes of an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme have gone before, it is an apoſtematous ulcer; if the purulent matter be but little, and no signes of an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation have beene noted, then it is but a primarie ulcer proceeding of eroſion, by reaſon of a ſharpe humor ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the unity of the ſubſtance of the lungs. Theſe internall ulcers I will leave to the conſideration of Phyſicians, unto whom they are moſt commonly preſented to be cured, who very often purchaſe fees with no ſmall diſcredit to the Art and themſelves. Onely I will ſet downe ſuch things as tend to the curation of ulcers of the externall parts. I need not to buſie my ſelfe about the ſetting downe of the generall ſignes of ſuch, ſeeing they are preſented to the view of the Chirurgeon by the parties grieved. Onely let me give you warning, that you miſtake not a wound for an ulcer: into this errour you may eaſily fall, if you admit the moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary deſcription of an ulcer, ſet downe even by judicious Phyſicians and Chirurgeons; which is,<note place="margin">Riolan.

It is ſtrange that there ſhould be ſet downe no other difference between a wound &amp; an ulcer, than this, that the one is blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the other purulent. Doth not, I pray you, a wound become purulent of it ſelfe, although no Chirurge on deale with it, and may not an ulcer become bloudy if inciſion be uſed, as it may dayly be ſeene? Frivolous it is alſo in my judgment, that a ſolution of unity inflicted by an inſtrument that woundeth in a bone, as a ſword, may be caned a wound, and that a ſolution of unity in a bone, procured by an ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding humor, may not be termed an ulcer.</p>

This is plaine in the bodies of hydropicall perſons, and thoſe which arſ aged, for as ſuperfluous humiditie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to deſiccation hindereth the healing in thoſe: ſo in theſe the defect of radicall moiſture. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> III. ulcers in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by reaſon of their exceſſive humiditie, and in women with child, becauſe the moſt laudable part of the blood is turned to the nouriſhment of the child, are not eaſely cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. IV. ulcers which fall out after criticall apoſtemes in the ſpondils of the back, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> or great joynts of the body, for the moſt part are mortall: becauſe after ſickneſſe, and apoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, nature muſt be exceedingly weakened, the naturall heat much abated, and the radicall moiſture almoſt ſpent. Such apoſtemes doe fall out when as ſharpe fevers end not crittically in the decretory daies by ſome evacuation, as blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the noſe, vomiting, ſweating, purging by ſtoole and urine, but extend themſelves to the fortieth day. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> V. If the place wherein the ulcer is ſeared be blackiſh, blowiſh, or greeniſh, it hardly can bet cured: for the bloud muſt bee naughty, and the fleſh corrupt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> VI. Ulcers of around fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure are cured with difficulty, the reaſon is this, Conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is procured by unition of the parts; now the farther the parts are aſunder, the more ſlowly it is procured: but a round figure, of all other within the ſame bounds, is moſt ample. VII. Painfull ulcers in children are dangerous, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> becauſe their bodies being raw, and the ſpirits ſubtill, they are eaſily ſpent, which is the cauſe that they are much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and ſo diſpoſed for death it ſelfe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> VIII. If an ulcer become either blewiſh or pale, the party being ill, death is not farre off; for theſe colours ſhew the mortification of the part; and dryneſſe ſheweth that the naturall moiſture is gone. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> IX. If an ulcer be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plicat with a diſeaſe which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth it, the ulcer, according to the nature of the diſeaſe,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16145:65"/>is either of eaſie or hard curation. So a venereall ulcer in a ſucculent and ſtrong body is eaſily cured, but if the party be in a <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> neither the ulcer nor the diſeaſe can be cured; becauſe the uſe of deſiccatives, which onely availe in theſe infirmities, will onely haſten death increaſing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation of the body: in like manner ulcers in hectick and hydropick perſons are hardly cured; in theſe becauſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous humidity hindereth deſiccation of the ulcer; in thoſe becauſe laudable juyce floweth not to the part ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. X. If tumors in ulcers ſuddenly vaniſh without any evident and manifeſt cauſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> as bleeding, or application of a diſcuſſive medicament, they portend no good: but convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; if they appeare in the hinder parts, becauſe the Spins is very nervous: and madneſſe, pleuriſie or ſuppuration if they were red, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> and in the forepart. XI. Soft tumors in ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are laudable, becauſe they will yeeld to medicaments, but hard, not eaſie to be cured, becauſe the humor is more rebellious. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> XII. If the haires fall in places of the body about the ulcer, it is an evill ſigne: for then there muſt be great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimonie, and corruption of the humors, as in quartane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, the pox, and leproſie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> XIII. If in an ulcer where there is carioſity of the bone, the colour of the fleſh be of a livid colour, the party muſt be in danger: for it is a ſigne of the extinction of the naturall heat. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> XIV. Ulcers which afford quittor, which is white, ſmooth, and uniforme, and not ſtinking, promiſe an eaſie cure, for theſe qualities in the quittor, ſhew the dominion of the naturall heat, and the ſoundneſſe of the ſolide parts. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> XV. A flux of bloud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in an ulcer after ſtrong pulſation is ominous, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Hippocrates Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>aph.</hi> 21. for there muſt bee a ſtrong phlegmon, and the arteries muſt be much preſſed, ſo that a gangren may be expected: howſoever of ſuch furious bloud no fleſh can be regenerate. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> XVI. If an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, the bone being bare, it is no good ſigne, <hi>Hipp. Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>aphor.</hi> 19. for neither can fleſh be regenerate by ſuch a ſharp humor as this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> that cauſeth ſo hot a tumor. XVII. From
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16145:65"/>maligne ulcers two forts of quittor flow; One thin, and it is called <hi>Ichor,</hi> or <hi>Sanies;</hi> ſuch a virulent matter iſſueth alſo from the pricking of the nerves, and corruption of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſtion. The other ſort of quittor is thick, and is called <hi>Sordes.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> XVIII. In ulcers which have continued a twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth or longer, the bone muſt be ſcaled, and the skinning be hollow, <hi>Hipp. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>aph.</hi> 45. But to make good this Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> ſome conditions are required: The firſt is, that much fleſh above the bone be not in the part ulcerate. Secondly, the humor which floweth to the part muſt be very corraſive. Thirdly, it muſt not have beene dealt withall by any Phyſician or Chirurgeon. If one or more of theſe conditions faile, the Aphoriſme muſt miſſe of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. What <hi>Galen</hi> and late Writers have ſet downe in the explication of this Aphoriſme, cleare not the truth of this Aphoriſme: onely theſe conditions ſet downe by me doe. The ſignes which leade you to the knowledge of a bone corrupted are theſe: 1. If the ulcer having beene skinned,<note place="margin">Signes of a corrupt bone.</note> breaketh out again, for it is likely that the bone caſteth out an ichorous ſubſtance, which is the cauſe of this recidivation, 2. If the ulcer yeeld more and thinner matter then the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it requireth. 3. If the brims of the ulcer will not come in. 4. If the brims become reddiſh. 5. If the bone, being preſented to the ſight, it appeare rugged, and of a blackiſh colour, not ſmooth, or a ruddy white colour. XIX. Whatſoever ulcers caſt out much <hi>Sanies</hi> or <hi>Ichorous</hi> matter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> which is too thin, of a leady, pale, or black colour; or glutinous, or ſtinking, and which fretteth the skin adjacent, are hard to be cured, for this humor keepeth the ulcer moiſt, and cannot eaſily be dryed, even if you apply powerfull Topicks. XX. Inveterate ulcers which caſt out a quittor, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> called by the Grecians <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, like unto white oyle, are hardly cured: for this ſignifieth a colliquation of the part, and an extenuation of the reſt of the body.</p>

               <p>It is not unknowne to your ſelves how many ſawcie and malepert Empiricks there are here in London, who baſely and irreverently ſpeak of thoſe who are skilfull indeed, and deſerve well of the Art of Chirurgerie, (purchaſing unto it credit, and to their owne ſelves profit and renowne, by their methodicall and ſucceſſefull practice) and ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently boaſt of their ſecrets, and exalt themſelves as if they had no forehead. But ſurely it is to be thought, that there is too great a diſtance betweene it and their tongue, that the forehead cannot ſtop the tongue from uttering Thraſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall ſpeeches of themſelves: it is great pity ſuch are ſo countenanced as they are.

               <p>That you may be the more able, not only to encounter with theſe confident cowards, but to overthrow them alſo; I will endevour, according to that talent of skill which I have, to furniſh you with competent both Theorie and Practice.

Let no man think then, that a skilfull and induſtrious Chirurgeon can by his Art performe no other cures, but ſuch as may be compaſſed by the compoſitions in his Salvatory. Theſe he muſt have in readineſſe, other medicaments he is able to fetch out of the treaſure of nature, which he hath at his command. This I will make good by the ſetting downe onely thoſe medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are known to belong to the curation of ulcers. Of theſe there are two orders or rankes: for ſome ſerve for ordinary ulcers, ſome for thoſe who have a malignity an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed. Thoſe that ſerve for ordinary ulcers are of five ſorts, for ſome are Repelling, ſome Digeſting, ſome Mundifying, ſome incarnating, and ſome Cicatrizing, and the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which performe theſe offices, are either ſimple or compound.</p>

Nature when ſhee is in her vigour cannot totally convert the aliments into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſolid parts, but after ſhe hath had a care of the preſervation of them, hath a task to expell both a wateriſh or thin, and a thick excrement by the pores of the skin to the outward ſuperficies of it, (as is manifeſt in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,) when ſhe is diſabled by a ſolution of unitie, much leſſe can ſhe effect her purpoſe, where of the thin excrement a humid ulcer is procured, but of the thick a ſordid.

                  <hi>LECT. VII.</hi> Of the curing of a plaine and hollow ulcor, being Simple.</head>
               <p>HAving paſſed thorow the ten points whereof I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſpeake, before I was to meddle with the curing of any particular ulcer, now it is time to deſeend to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe the method of curing of ulcers in particular. I would have you to call to remembrance the materiall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of ulcers delivered by me in the third Chapter, which were taken either from the nature and conſtitution of an ulcer, or from the parts affected: from the nature of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16145:74"/>the ulcer I deduced two ſorts of them: ſome I called ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſome compounded. Now the ſimple ulcer is to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſuch an one, as hath neither a diſeaſe, cauſe, or ſymptome annexed to it, or complicate, beſides the ſolution of unitie cauſed by croſion. Of theſe ſimple ulcers there are two kindes: for ſome are plaine, and equall to the naturall skin, wherein only the <hi>Cuticula</hi> and <hi>Cutis</hi> are loſt.<note place="margin">Galen. lib. <hi>3.</hi> meth. c. <hi>3.</hi>

It is not needfull ſeverally to ſet downe the curation of <hi>ulcur planum,</hi> or <hi>aequale,</hi> a plaine, or even ulcer; becauſe in proſecuting the indications of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>ulcur cavum,</hi> a hollow ulcer, I muſt ſet downe the meanes of curing a plaine one: for this is contained as a part in the other.</p>
               <p>Seeing then there are two affections in a hollow ulcer,<note place="margin">Indications of curing an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ulcer.</note> to wit, ſolution of unitie; and cavitie, three ſcopes of curing offer themſelves, unition, incarnation, and cicatrization.

                  </hi> which is reaſonable thick, three ſorts of excrements appeare in ulcers.</p>
               <p>The firſt is thin, watriſh, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> like to water wherein fleſh hath beene waſhed: this hath received no alteration, but hath flowed pure, as it is in the veines and fleſh; this is called <hi>Ichor.</hi> The ſecond is thin too, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> but it hath received ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration by the temperature of the part, this is called <hi>Sanies,</hi> or <hi>Virus.</hi> The third is verie thicke and glutinous, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> and is called <hi>Sordes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the excrements which are thin moyſten the part ulcerate, that it cannot ſufficiently diſcharge it ſelfe by breathing out the humiditie. Wherefore Deſiccatives are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16145:75"/>to be uſed to conſume this ſuperfluous moyſture: but the excrements which are thick cleave to the part, and hinder the addition of fleſh.<note place="margin">After Mundiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</note> Theſe are met withall by abſterſives or mundificatives.

                     </gap>.</note> There are two cauſes of this fleſh which is to bee procured: 1. Is the efficient cauſe: This is nature it ſelfe not onely of the whole body; but of the part it ſelfe alſo, which is called <hi>Temperies,</hi> the naturall tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature or conſtitution of it: whereby it attracteth, conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, applyeth and aſſimilateth the nouriſhment to it ſelfe. 2. Is the materiall cauſe: this is ſincere and pure bloud. If the part ulcerate enjoy ſuch, then nothing remaineth but to maintain it: If the bloud be not pure, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hen it is to be altered, if it be too hot it is to be cooled, if too cold it is to bee war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, if it be too thin it is to be thickened, if it be too thick it is to be attenuate; if there be too great plentie of it, it is to be diminiſhed; if it be too little, then it is to be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by convenient order of diet.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of curing a ſimple ulcer.</note>To come necrer to the curarion of a ſimple ulcer: Firſt, we muſt diſcreetly order thoſe things which are called not naturall: ſeeing a convenient diet preſerveth and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the good conſtitution of the whole body, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the part:<note place="margin">Diet.</note> Wherefore all thoſe meats and drinke which make the bloud too hot, too ſharp, too thin, or too thicke, are to be ſhunned, and thoſe onely to be permitted which afford good juyce, and are of eaſie concoction, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the diſeaſed partie be tender and weake. Beſides this they muſt be taken moderately, and at convenient times. The part it ſelfe muſt bee kept quiet:<note place="margin">Quietneſſe.</note> for motion hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the part. Care alſo is to bee had of ſleeping and wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: for as watching dryeth the body, and conſumeth ſuperfluous humiditie, ſo ſleeping moyſteneth the parts; but thoſe chiefly which are nervous or ſinewie, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, tendons, ligaments. If then the ulcer be humid, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne watching; if it be drie, command ſleeping. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16145:75"/>vacuation of the excrements, let it bee appointed that they may anſwer in quantitie the food which the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed partie taketh. If he prove coſtive, either miniſter unto him a glyſter, or give him an ounce of <hi>Electuarium leniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum</hi> in chicken broth. As perturbations of the minde change the ſtate of the whole body, ſo the tranquillitie of it maintaineth the ſame. A ſpeciall care is to be had of the aire; for it wonderfully preſerveth the temperature of the part. Southerly and Northerly winds or not fit for ulcers: for as the firſt moyſteneth and heateth, ſo the ſecond doth much coole and dry: but cold is an enemy to ulcers. So it is obſerved that the aire in Angieu is hurtfull to ulcers in the legs, but in Paris good. So in Piſe and Ferrara it is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; but in Florence wholſome.<note place="margin">Prognoſticks.</note> As for the prognoſticks of ſimple ulcers: If I ſhould ſet downe any, you might juſtly thinke I did abuſe the time: for there is none ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who may not gather out of the verie denomination of them, that they are moſt eaſie to bee cured, and that great skill is not required to compaſſe the ſame: onely let mee give you warning that the cure may be either more eaſie, or hard, according to the nature of the part ulcerate, and the diet of the patient. So ſimple ulcers are more eaſily cured in a fleſhy part, than in the joynt or a nervous part; for in theſe ſtronger deſiccatives are required, and in them the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heat is not ſo powerfull to make uſe of the medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments applyed. In like manner a ſimple ulcer is more eaſily cured in the body of a temperate perſon, than it is in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of one given to deboſhry. Having ſet downe the right uſe of the things not naturall, as diet, ſleeping and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, evacuation of the excrements, the perturbations of the minde and aire, I am to deliver unto you ſome locall medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments for the accompliſhing of the curation of theſe ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, according to the generall indications of curing ſet downe in the fifth Chapter.</p>

But ſeeing the skin is framed in the womb of a ſeminall matter, it being loſt it cannot be reſtored by reaſon of the defects of matter: Wherefore we muſt finde out another cover. This cover is called by Artiſts <hi>Cicatrix:</hi> This is nothing elſe but the uppermoſt <hi>Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of the fleſh ſo dried, that it doth repreſent the skin.

               <p>This <hi>Cicatrix</hi> is procured by three meanes, by nature it

Secondly, many times a ſcab covereth ſuch ulcers being incarnate, which being removed, or falling away of it ſelfe, the place appeareth skinned: onely nature is the cauſe of this: for no medicament was applyed. Thirdly, if nature had not a hand in this buſineſſe, ſuch an order would not be obſerved, that the brims of the ulcer ſhould firſt be skinned, and then the middle. Fourthly, nature worketh in her actions to the period appointed: ſo in an ulcer ſhee not being hindred fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the ulcer with fleſh even unto the uppermoſt Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which being done ſhe ceaſeth from affording any more matter of fleſh, whereby it commeth to paſſe that the upper Superficies being deprived of further nouriſhment muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dry.</p>

               <p>As for the humor,<note place="margin">How cauſes in flowing are to be met withall.</note> if it be in flowing, then you are to meet with it with the ordering the things called, not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; as aire, meat and drink, ſleeping &amp; watching, evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſuch like, and by purging of the humor offending: whereof I ſpake ſufficiently in the doctrine concerning Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.<note place="margin">How humours flowing are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</hi> 2.</note> If it hath flowed to the part, and be impacted in it, then it is to be removed by three meanes: to wit, by drying, expreſſing, and removing of the cauſes of the fluxion.</p>
               <p>You ſhall dry the humor, if you uſe ſarcoticall medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> drying at the leaſt in the third degree, as Bones cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined, Harts-hornes calcined, and made up in Trochiſces with Plantane, and Roſe-water, <hi>Aesuſtum,</hi> the Pumick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone calcined, <hi>Calaminaris,</hi> Borax, the powders of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentill, Biſtorts, Comfrey, and ſuch like; whereof I have
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16145:78"/>ſpoken ſufficiently before: yet <hi>Nunquam ſatis dicitur quod nunquam ſatis diſcitur,</hi> a thing remarkable can never be too much pointed at; ſo fluxible and gliding are the objects of our memory.</p>
               <p>You ſhall expreſſe the humors: Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> by uſing ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling medicaments as I have often ſpoken of, which are to be applied to the parts adjacent to the ulcers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by rowling the ulcer, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> preſcribeth in his Treatiſe of Fractures, that it begin about the ulcer, uſing ſo many revolutions, or windings of the rowler, as are fit, and ending in the ſound part.</p>
               <p>As for the cauſes of fluxion they are three; tranſmiſſion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> attraction, and the furious motion of the humnor it ſelfe.<note place="margin">Galen. <hi>2.</hi> de dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. feb. <hi>11.</hi> &amp; <hi>12.</hi> method. <hi>3, 4, 5.</hi>
                  </note> A part ſendeth either moved by the ſuperfluity of the humor, or urged by the offending quality, or both. If the humor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in quantity abounding, then it is to be abated by phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomie, purging, ſlender diet, and ſuch meanes as have been delivered by me in the Treatiſe of Tumors, to leſſen pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or <hi>Plethora,</hi> the ſignes whereof I delivered there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, ſo that I need not to repeat them here. If the humor offend in quality, urging and pricking the part to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of it, as the liver, which being tainted with the French-pox, ſendeth the humor to the groynes, yard, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, the fundament and throat. When wee have obſerved and noted the quality and nature of the humor, then wee are to goe about the expulſion, or alteration of it, or both.</p>
               <p>If the humor offend both in quantity and quality, then are we to uſe both purging and altering. Now to finde out the humors in quality offending, ſeeing I have ſet downe their pathognomonicall, &amp; proper fignes, when I diſcourſed of every ſpeciall Turnor, I will remit you, at this time, to the places where they were ſet downe. If humors doe flow by reaſon of the attraction of the part; it is procured either by the heat, or the paine of the part.<note place="margin">Gal. <hi>4.</hi> meth. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; <hi>13.</hi> meth. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> If a humor flow to the ulcer, neither being ſent from a part, nor received by a part; but becauſe the humor it ſelfe is eliquat, either by the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16145:79"/>vehement perturbations of the minde, or an aguiſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or the exhibition of an eradicative, or ſtrong medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament: then the tranquility of the minde is to be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the aguiſh heat to be abated, and the exhibition of ſuch medicaments to be ſtayed. Having ſpoken of the fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humors ſo much as is fit for our preſent purpoſe, now I am to touch briefly the other cauſe of milde, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ulcers: to wit, the diſtemperature of the part.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the part.</note> The ſingle diſtemperatures are in number foure: to wit, toodry, too moiſt, too hot, too cold. A dry diſtemperature is found out by theſe ſignes: the colour of the ulcerate part is ill-favoured, not lively, little or no matter floweth from it, in touching it ſeemeth hard and dry.</p>
               <p>This diſtemperature is removed by two meanes: Firſt, by drawing out the naturall humidity to the part affected, by opening the paſſages, which before by reaſon of immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate dryneſſe were drawne together. In this caſe friction is excellent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, dryneſſe is removed by the application of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mecting medicaments. Two ſuch are commended by the Ancients, pure Spring-water, and Water and Oyle mingled together.</p>
               <p>As for the uſe of Spring or River-water, it muſt bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied luke warme, not very hot; for if it be very hot, it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſeth; becauſe the humors having beene attenuate by it, they are turned into vapours, and ſo reſolved: but if it be temperately hot, and the part fomented by it, it moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond medicament compoſed of Water and Oyle, by the Ancients is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The ulcerate part im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately dry, is to be fomented with this medicament warme: Take either two parts of Water, and one of Oyle, or equall; warme them in a ſingle Viall-glaſſe, then ſhake them well together, that they may be mingled, and apply the medicament. This is a convenient Topick in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for although warme water warmeth the part during
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16145:79"/>the time of fomentation, yet after fomentation it leaveth the part cold, becauſe it drew out the heat to the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the body: wherefore oyle is excellent, for it ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the pores and keepeth in the heat.

               <p>HAving diſcourſed in my former Lecture of thoſe things which make the milder ſort of ulcers to be accompted compound, to wit, a ſickneſſe, cauſe, or ſymptome compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with an ulcer. In this Lecture I will ſet downe the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of milder ulcers, and the curation of them. Theſe differences are taken either from the figure or adjuncts: from the figure theſe. Of the milder compound ulcers ſome are plaine, ſome ſinewous. I call that a plaine ulcer, wherein the skin is eroded, and the ſubjacent fleſh, and the whole ulcer is preſented to the ſight, being bare and unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. No compound ulcer is to bee accompted of an eaſie curation: becauſe both skill and experience are required in performing this.</p>
               <p>And although theſe plaine ulcers be ſubject wholly to the ſight, yet let no man imagine that all of them are of equall facilitie to be cured; for according to the nature of the griefe, the qualitie of the cauſe, and the invaſion of the ſymptomes, the ulcers with the which theſe things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate, are either of more eaſie or difficult curation. A plaine compound ulcer hath three ſcopes in curation of it: for firſt,<note place="margin">Indications of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe burrowes are found out by probes of ſilver, or lead, &amp; wax-candles: If there be more orifices than one, by injections. They ſometimes are ſuperficiall,<note place="margin">Their figures.</note> ſometimes deepe, ſometimes ſtraight, ſometimes oblique, ſometimes there is but one caverne, ſometimes there be more.</p>

Thirdly, in the orifice put in a leaden tent, or pipe; but ſhort, hollow, wider in the upper than lower part, &amp; having the brims of the upper part turned, that it may be kept from ſlipping in, ſhut the orifice and the upper part of the tent or pipe with an emplaſter; let it be one of thoſe named before: the emplaſter muſt bee ſnipt, that it may give way to the quittour which floweth out of the cavitie: above the emplaſter apply a peece of a ſpunge, which muſt be ſoft, moyſtned with the medicament with the which you dreſſe the ulcer, and wrung out: for the ſpunge ſucketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelfe the quittour, keepeth the brims of the orifice dry, and preſerveth them from excoriations: above the ſpunge lay a pledget of tow: the lower cavitie, or from the bottome of the ulcer to the orifice it muſt be boniſtered. Above all lay a double ſoft linnen cloth. Begin your rowling at the bottome, where it muſt bee ſomewhat ſtrait, to bring the ſides of the ulcer together, both to expreſſe the quittour, and to procure agglutination, but let it cauſe no paine; for it would diſtemper the part: towards the orifice the row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling muſt bee ſomewhat ſlacke, that the quittour may have way to iſſue out. Everie third day (if much matter doth not flow) dreſſe it, looſe firſt the rowler, the turnings whereof
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16145:82"/>are about the orifice, take away the ſpunge and emplaſter; firſt, that you may come to cleanſe the ulcer; ſecondly, that you may make triall whether nature doth goe about to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinate the parts: which you ſhall diſcerne,<note place="margin">Signes of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination.</note> if the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious matter abate, bee laudable in colour and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, and have no ill ſmell, and if the cavitie bee without paine, and without any remarkable tumor: By the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, if the quittour be plentifull, ill-coloured and ſtinking, if the cavitie be painfull, and a conſpicuous tumor appeare, you may perſwade your ſelves that no unition is procured. Dreſſe the ulcer according to this manner, untill perfect ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination be cauſed, which you ſhall know by the ſignes aforeſaid going before, if no quittour or verie little appeare in the orifice, if the cavitie be equall without tumour, and no paine be felt: when you perceive theſe ſignes, then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe your ſelves for the cicatrizing of the ulcer. If after a dreſſing or two, thin gleeting matter appeare, yet deſpaire not; for often times ſuch matter is wrung out of the parts by reaſon of the medicament drying: the nature of the part, as being nervous, membranous, or glandulous; or laſtly, by compreſſing of the ulcer by bolſtering and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. As for the emplaſter applyed to the cavitie it ſelfe, it is to be renewed when it is defiled with quittour, or leaveth cleaving. Dreſſe the ulcer as ſeldome as you can,<note place="margin">Why ſuch an ulcer is not to bee dreſſed often.</note> contrarie to the practice of Empyricks; for often dreſſing doth give way to cold aire, which is hurtfull to ulcers, and hindreth unition. Thus you may proceed in curing of cavernous ulcers, if the excrementitious matter have way to flow from them freely, which will be if the orifice be in a depending part, or late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, the cavitie or <hi>ſinus</hi> being laterall alſo; for then, ſuch a poſture may be appointed, as will further the evacuation of the matter: But if by reaſon of other figures of the cavitie, the cavitie cannot diſcharge it ſelfe of the filth of the ulcer,<note place="margin">The manner of curing of theſe ulcers by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> then untill this impediment be removed, no expurgation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, or agglutination can bee expected: wherefore way is to be made by inciſion or cauſtick.</p>

                  <hi>LECT. X.</hi> Of the palliative cure of a ſinuous ulcer with calloſitie in generall.</head>
               <p>IN my laſt Lecture which I delivered from this place, the vacation from theſe exerciſes being at hand, I ſpake of a ſinuous or hollow ulcer, without a calloſitie or hardneſſe of the inner Superficies of the parts disoyned: Now the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of doctrine requireth that I diſcourſe of a ſinuous ulcer, which hath a calloſitie in theſe ſame parts. In times paſt it hath been accompted a maſter-peece in the practice of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie to cure ſuch: In ſo much that Maſter <hi>Boovie</hi> the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16145:84"/>Counſellors father, a brother of this Companie while hee lived, dwelling in Tower-ſtreet, ſet up above his doore a new ſigne with this inſcription; <hi>Here dwelleth one who can cure a Fiſtula:</hi> young <hi>Hall</hi> having acquainted him with his fathers practice. And in truth not a ſmall skill, or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie proceeding is required to effect this matter: for the greateſt part of ſuch an ulcer lyeth hid, and little is offered to the eye. Beſides this, ordinarie meanes are for the moſt part here ineffectuall, and ſo magiſtrall meanes are required. Wherefore I have diligently laboured to couch in this my diſcourſe whatſoever can be required in the curing of ſuch an ulcer, as you ſhall perceive in my proceeding.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, I will deliver the generall doctrine of this kinde of ulcer: then I will ſet downe the manner of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſuch in ſome particular parts of the body. A ſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or hollow ulcer with a calloſitie or hardneſſe in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſuperficies of the parts disjoyned and ſeparated is called in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from the ſimilitude which it hath with the long and hollow windie inſtruments of Muſicians: in Latine it is called <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> and ſo in the Engliſh tongue for this ſame cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The definition.</note>A <hi>Fiſtula</hi> then is a ſinuous ulcer, narrow and long with calloſitie. Here you are to obſerve, that a Fiſtula beſides ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuoſitie, muſt have calloſitie and narrowneſſe. It happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth moſt commonly, when apoſtemes having been opened,<note place="margin">The cauſe materiall.</note> the inner Superficies of the parts kept aſunder by a ſharp hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, become in progreſſe of time callous. The humour which cauſeth this calloſitie muſt bee more aſtringent than ſharp; for it rather tanneth the part by reaſon of its acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitie, than erodeth by reaſon of its acrimonie: beſides this, Fiſtula's are for the moſt part indolent, unleſſe they end in parts verie ſenſible, as nerves, tendons, membranes and joynts. Wherefore the Chymiſts will have this humour to be the Salpeter of the little world, or man, ſeparate from the naturall ſalt of the Balſame, or radicall moyſture of the body: that this ſalt is cooling and anodine, the Practicers
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16145:85"/>of Phyſick doe beare witneſſe: for in burning fevers it is added to Juleps, which are appointed for cooling, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaging of paine under the name of <hi>Sal prunellae:</hi> It doth alſo, by reaſon of its ſtipticitie unite the ſpirits, and ſtay the immoderate exhalation of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſignes.</note>The ſignes are taken either from the eſſence of a Fiſtula, or from the accidents. Calloſitie then with a Fiſtula, or whiſtle-like figure, is the pathognomonicall ſigne of a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula. The ſignes taken from the accidents are two-fold: for they are taken either from the quittour, or the manner of paine. In a Fiſtula the quittour is ever virulent, ugly and ſtinking; as for the manner of paine it is but ſmall, unleſſe it be by reaſon of the ſenſibleneſſe of the parts named by me before.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>As for the differences, or divers kindes of Fiſtula's, I will onely ſet downe thoſe, which further either curation, or prediction. Let this then bee the firſt difference: Fiſtula's either goe ſhallowly alongſt under the skin, or they paſſe deeper to the ſubjacent parts. Secondly, Fiſtula's end ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the fleſhy parts, or they paſſe to the bones, or to the cavities themſelves. Thirdly, ſome are ſtraight, ſome croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Fourthly, ſome are ſingle, ſome manyfold, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from one orifice. Theſe are the materiall, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable differences of Fiſtula's.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſignes of the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>Now followeth that I ſpeake of the ſignes of theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. 1. Whether there be more callous ſinuofities than one, you may conjecture by the quantitie of the quittour; for if more copious quittour flow from a Fiſtula than can be expected from one <hi>Sinus,</hi> it not paſſing to any remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cavitie, it is likely that there are more than one. The changing alſo of the poſition of the body, and compreſſion of the part will ſhew this; for the flowing of the matter having ceaſed, if after the changing of the poſition of the whole body, or one member, it run out againe, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that there are more ſinuoſities. Moreover, if varietie of quittour flow, it is an argument that ſundry parts are
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16145:85"/>affected, and more ſinuoſities like to be. But to what parts the Fiſtula paſſeth, receive theſe ſignes: If it paſſe to the fleſhy parts, the quittour appeareth white, ſmooth &amp; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull; beſides this, the part whereon the end of the probe ſtayeth ſeemeth ſoft. If it paſſe to a nerve, a fattie &amp; oleous matter doth iſſue out, the motion which is cauſed by that ſinew is impaired, and the Fiſtula is more painfull than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are; beſides, the probe touching the ſinew, cauſeth a pricking paine, with a certaine numneſſe. If the Fiſtula paſſe to the veines and arteries, yet ſo that the coats of them be not eroded, then the matter which it yeeldeth is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lees of Claret wine; for bloud ſwearing thorow the coats of poroſities of the veſſels mingled with the quittour, cauſeth ſuch a ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>If the coat of a veine bee corroded, bloud iſſueth thick, of a dark colour, and without quavering and leaping; but if the tunicles of an arterie bee pierced, then the bloud is redder, of a more bright colour, and commeth forth with ejaculation. If a Fiſtula reach to the bone, that which the end of the probe toucheth appeareth hard, and yeeldeth not to the probe, neither is any paine felt. If the probe being preſſed ſlip, no carioſitie hath ſeiſed upon the bone; for a ſound bone is ſmooth and ſlipperie: If the probe ſtay upon it appearing ſmooth, it is diſpoſed to carioſitie; but if the bone appeare unequall and rough, then it is undoubtedly carious. Beſides this, the quittour which floweth from a corrupt bone is thin, yellow, and ill-ſmelling. So much then concerning the ſignes, which ſhew us the divers kindes of Fiſtula's.</p>
               <p>Now let me deliver unto you ſome remarkable preſages or predictions, touching the curing of them, that you may become circumſpect in undertaking the curation of ſuch as ſhall be preſented to you. Let this then be the firſt:</p>
               <p>No Fiſtula is of eaſie curation. Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> by reaſon of the unaptneſſe of the part to admit the convenient application of medicaments: for unleſſe they reach to the verie extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16145:86"/>of the Fiſtula, which is not ſo eaſie a matter, as you ſhall finde by practice no good can be done. Secondly, by reaſon of the qualitie of the medicaments, which are able to remove the calloſitie; for theſe muſt be ſharp and biting, and ſo cauſe paine: from whence come ſymptomaticall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and fainting verie often, eſpecially in tender and young bodies. And thirdly, by reaſon of the humour, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a Fiſtula, which yeeldeth not to ordinarie and vulgar medicaments. Let this be the ſecond.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Fiſtula's which are ſhallow, paſſing no deeper than the <hi>Membrana carnoſa,</hi> or at the furtheſt than the membrane of the muſcules, or muſcule ſubjacent, are more eaſily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than thoſe which pierce deeper; for thoſe by inciſion may eaſily be cured, but theſe not ſo.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The third ſhall be this: Fiſtula's wreathed, or with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicitie of ſinuoſities, require inciſion, that medicaments may be conveyed to all the parts.</p>
               <p>The fourth: If a Fiſtula no paſſing further than the fleſhy parts, bee not of a long continuance, and that in a young and a ſtrong body, it affordeth good hope of curing: Imagine the contrarie event, if contrarie circumſtances bee accompanied.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Receive this as the fourth: If the extremitie of a Fiſtula end in the tunicles of veines or arteries, or both, (the ſignes whereof I have delivered, when I ſpake of the differences of Fiſtula's) then you are to meet with the ſymptome of hemorrage, the coats being eroded: for if you labour ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enlarge the orifice, or to take away the calloſitie by ſharp medicaments, the flux will bee encreaſed. This acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happeneth moſt commonly in Bubo's of the groyne not ſpeedily cured, and Parotides under the eare, and Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the arme-pits: Theſe parts being emunctorous, and nere to the divarication of the great veſſels, to wit, the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> and the <hi>Aorta</hi> deſcending and aſcending.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Fiſtula's ending in verie ſenſible parts, as nerves, tendons, the bladder, the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> and the like, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16145:86"/>and mildly to be handled, by reaſon of the ſymptomes which often enſue, as accidentall fevers, Lipothimies, loſſe of appetite and ſleepe: all which are apt to bring an exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation unto the whole body, and ſo to defraud the part of more than requiſite nouriſhment, without the which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation cannot be effected.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Fiſtula's in remarkable cavities, as the throat, breſt, belly, are hard to be cured, becauſe the end is more dependant than the orifice, which hindreth exceedingly conſolidation.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> If in Fiſtula's of the back the <hi>Spina</hi> be carious, ſhun the care; for theſe at the length bring an extenuation of the body, the animal ſpirits not being with requiſite plentie communicate to the extremities of the body.</p>
               <p>Fiſtula's in the joynts are dangerous; for if great wounds of the joynts, even in bodies of a good habit, bee pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to be mortall: what ſhall wee deeme of Fiſtula's in theſe parts, where beſides the enorme dilatation that muſt be procured in curation, there is of a neceſſitie an ill complexion of the body. Secondly, ſeeing the joynts are framed of parts verie ſenſible, as tendons, nerves, membranes and ligaments, exceeding great paine muſt be cauſed by the application of corroſive medicaments, without the which a Fiſtula cannot be cured, and ſo the partie exceedingly bee troubled and perplexed. Thirdly, ſeeing the joynts are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in depending parts, and are not fleſhy: and ſo as they are apt to receive humours attracted by paine, they are leſſe able to diſcuſſe the humours received, partly by reaſon of the thickneſſe of the membranes, partly by reaſon of the weakneſſe of the naturall heat: who may not eaſily perceive the difficultie of curing of Fiſtula's in theſe parts?</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> Fiſtula's having ſund y ſinuoſities are more hardly cured than thoſe which have but one, both becauſe the labour is the greater, and the medicaments cannot ſo conveniently be applyed.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> Fiſtula's which have continued a long time ſeated in a depending part, remote from any principall, by the which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16145:87"/>nature hath beene accuſtomed to diſcharge ſuperfluities of the whole body, and not painfull, but rather ſlovenly or ſluttiſh, are rather to be kept open than cured; for they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the health of the body, and hinder the aſſault of other diſeaſes.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Indications of curing.</note>Now it is time to haſten to the ſetting downe of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Fiſtula's in generall. In the ſixth Section of the Treatiſes aſcribed to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> there is one of Fiſtula's: In it he doth ſpeake ſomewhat particularly of a Fiſtula <hi>in ano,</hi> and of the curing of it by ligation. Whatſoever is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in that Treatiſe, ſeemeth to be an exſcription of notes out of his <hi>Adverſaria</hi> or Note-booke, rather than a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or methodicall diſcourſe of the ſubject.

Peruſe the Treatiſe, and you ſhall finde me to ſpeake a truth, if you ſhew your ſelves impartiall cenſurers. Seing I have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto you in the preſages of Fiſtula's, that ſometimes it is moſt expedient to leave ſome Fiſtula's uncured, I muſt make mention of a two-fold manner of curing of them: The one ſhall be called palliative or cloaked;<note place="margin">Two kindes of curation.</note> the other true and reall. The firſt affordeth ſome conſolation and eaſe to the patient; but the ſecond procureth perfecteſt health. A palliative cure, I would have you to underſtand, to be when ſinuoſitie is inwardly dryed for a time, and the orifice ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be ſhut up by a thin skin, untill freſh and new hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miditie bedew the inward ſinuoſitie, and open the orifice
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16145:87"/>againe. This kinde of curation is moſt fit to bee uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe, in whoſe bodies a Fiſtula ſupplyeth the place of a fontanell, to diſcharge ſuperfluous humours, which nature turneth out from the principall parts, for the preſervation of the health of the body.</p>
               <p>You ſhall know this manner of curing to be uſed, if the partie immediately before the opening of the orifice finde ſome diſtemperature, and afterward the orifice being ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, eaſe. To compaſſe this manner of cure three intentions are required.</p>
               <p>Firſt, convenient diet muſt be obſerved: This is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by feeding upon ſuch meats as are of eaſie concoction, and afford good juyce, and in ſuch meaſure as <hi>Leonardus Leſſius</hi> in his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> preſcribeth, and <hi>Ludovicus Cornarus</hi> obſerved from his conſtant to his decrepit age. They adviſe moderation both in meat and drinke. Patients now adayes would thinke themſelves hardly dealt with, if they ſhould be ſtinted everie day to eat no more bread and meat than a pound, and to drinke no more drink than fourteene ounces. It is an eaſier matter to ſatisfie nature, than the appetite.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the body is to bee purged not by any eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive medicament, wherein Scammonie, Ellebore, or Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynth entreth; but a purging diet, or a purging Ale; I will deliver unto you a patterne of both.

When either of theſe purgatives are miniſtred, let the Patient about ten a clock in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone take ſome broth without bread, made of a Chicken, Mutton, or Veale, wherein Mallow, Parſley, Fennill, and Succorie roots, with ſome Raiſins, Prunes and Dates have beene boyled. Let him dine on the boyled meat; but ſup with roſt meat. The purging Ale is more convenient for aged perſons, than the decoction, and for ſuch as have a weake ſtomack.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, convenient locall medicaments are to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, to further the drying of the ſinuoſitie, and skinning of the orifice. I will onely ſet downe two injections for the firſt. The one is this: Take of <hi>Aqua calcis,</hi> wherein ſome Litharge either of gold or ſilver hath beene boyled iij. o℥. and of the Syrup of red Roſe leaves dried, or of the Mirtill berries one ounce: mingle theſe together. The other is this: Take of Plantane water iij. o℥. of Roman Vitriol beat to powder, a dram and an halfe: let the Vitriol diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in the water: inject theſe medicaments warme; apply to the orifice a pledget of lint wet in either of theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, and above the lint <hi>Diapalma cum ſuceis.</hi> Dreſſe the Fiſtula everie other day only, unleſſe the quittour which floweth from the Fiſtula be plentifull. So you have the palliative cure of a Fiſtula.

               <p>Firſt of all then the Fiſtula is to be dilated; for ſeldome doth it fall out otherwayes, that this indication is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, unleſſe it be in a Fiſtula in the cheeke, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> which was cauſed and maintained by a corrupt tooth, which being drawne, the Fiſtula will heale of it ſelfe, a conſolidative em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter being applyed to keepe out the aire.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How to dilate a Fiſtula.</note>The Fiſtula may bee dilated three manner of wayes, by Inciſion, by putting in tents framed of ſuch things as ſwell, after they have imbibed the humiditie of the Fiſtula; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and laſt of all by the Fiſtula tent.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Inciſion when it is to be uſed.</note>As for Inciſion, it is to bee uſed in ſtrong bodies, if the Fiſtula be not deepe and onely runneth alongſt under the skin, no deeper than the membrane of a muſcule, if it be in a fleſhy part. Secondly, if the Fiſtula have many ſinuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: before the Inciſion is made, the Fiſtula is to be dilated by ſome of the three other meanes, which I will deliver pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently: ſecondly, the medicaments which remove the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſitie (whereof anon muſt be applyed) both theſe intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt bee performed before Inciſion, otherwayes you ſhall hardly know how far your Inciſion is to bee extended, and ſhall leave ſome part of the Callus ſtill, which will make way for recidivation and relapſe.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The ſecond way to dilate a Fiſtula, is to uſe inſtead of tents ſuch things as ſwell, whereof there bee ſundrie, as the Gentian root, the pith of the Elder, or Dane-woort; but
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16145:90"/>the ſpunge twiſted with threed,<note place="margin">The uſe of the ſpunge.</note> after that it is wrung hard and wrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hed, far exceedeth all theſe; for it both imbibeth more moyſture, and dilateth much more. I will acquaint you with a preparation of the ſpunge, which is excellent, and this is it: Melt a rowle of your ſimple Melilot empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; when it is yet verie hot, let a thick ſpunge imbibe it. This ſpunge having ſo drawne unto it ſelfe the emplaſter, put betweene two trenchers, which trenchers with the ſpunge put into a ſtrong preſſe, and preſſe them hard. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an houre or two, when you thinke the ſpunge to bee cold, unſcrue the preſſe, and take out the trenchers with the ſpunge, you ſhall finde the ſpunge become a firme ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, reſembling greene cheeſe. Of this ſubſtance you may cut out tents of what faſhion you will: This will not onely exceedingly dilate the Fiſtula, by ſucking unto it the humiditie; but will alſo digeſt the calloſitie.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The third way of dilating a Fiſtula, I ſet downe to bee by the Fiſtula tent. It is this way to bee made; Make good ſtore of fine lint, from the which draw away all the threeds, that nothing remaine but the fluet, or the ſoft downe of it; of this downe with the white of an egge beaten, make your tents of what thickneſſe or length the ſinuoſitie of the Fiſtula requireth, by adding ſtill ſome of downe: doe this upon a peece of a Deale-board ſmooth and even: If you ſtill enlarge the quantitie of the tents, you may dilate the Fiſtula as much as you will; for theſe tents being dried, will pierce unto any cavititie as a probe without bending (if they bee well made) by reaſon of their ſtiffneſſe. Of this manner of tent there is great uſe, in taking away the callo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of ſome Fiſtula's, and in healing of them, beſides this uſe, as you ſhall heare anon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond Chirurgicall attention.</note>The ſecond Chirurgicall intention is to remove the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus: this is bred by reaſon of the influxion of an humor, not of an uniforme ſubſtance; for beſides the thin parts, which are diſcuſſed or dryed,<note place="margin">The matteriall cauſe of a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</note> by both naturall and extraneous heat, it muſt have a thick ſubſtance to cauſe this callus, it being

In progreſſe of time Fiſtula's having become inveterate, the whole paſſage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth calloſitie.</p>

                  <note place="margin">To know wher the paſſage hath alſo a Callus.</note>You ſhall know by this, whether the paſſage be fiſtulated or no: If by the intruſion of the probe great paine is felt, and bloud iſſueth out, the Callus is not confirmed; but if no bloud follow, an little paine be felt, bee ſure then that it is confirmed.</p>
               <p>

The medicaments are of three degrees: for ſome are more milde, and theſe are of an emolliating and digeſting qualitie, fit if the calloſitie bee but ſmall in a fleſhy part and a young body: ſuch are <hi>Diolthaea cum gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> and <hi>Vnguentum de poeto.</hi> Everie ounce of either of them having a dram of the Turbith minerall, or Precipitate mingled with Allome with it, is effectuall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſome are more harſh; for they muſt mundifie ſtrongly, if the Callus bee ſomewhat hard, and the partie ſomewhat aged: ſuch are <hi>Vnguentum Apoſtolorum, Avicen.</hi> having Precipitate and Allome, or the Turbith with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome mingled with it, Aegyptiacum is ſtronger than this; but I ſhould rather uſe the <hi>Vnguentum Apoſtolorum</hi> than it, adding more of the aforenamed cathaereticall powder to it; for it cauſeth greater paine, and procureth not ſo good quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour as the <hi>Apoſtolorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the medicaments which are to remove an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Callus are Cauſtick: and even of theſe ſome are more gentle, ſome exceeding fierce. The more gentle are

               <p>Of the ſtrongeſt of all I will deliver unto you two magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrall deſcriptions only, farre ſurpaſſing all others.

Vitrioli vomitivi, &amp; Terraerubr. oriental. an. part. aequales.</hi> II. is this which Iuſe in Fiſtula's and Struma's: ℞ <hi>Realgar. albi, Auripigment. &amp; Calcis vivae, an. part. aequales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may enquire how theſe are to be uſed: If you have dilated the Fiſtula by inciſion, beſprinkle the Callus with ſome of the powders; but if you have done it by the ſecond way ſet downe by me, then uſe the powders mingled with <hi>Vnguentum Populeon,</hi> wherewith arme your Fiſtula tent: or apply a Trochisk made of theſe powders and Populeum, and afterwards dryed.</p>
               <p>After the application either of the Fiſtula tent armed with the unguent, or of the Trochisk, two things you are to obſerve: I. That you apply an anodine caraplaſme, the fellow to this which I ſhall now deliver unto you ſhall not be found. It is alſo matchleſſe in raging paines of the Gout: ℞ <hi>Lact. Vaccin.</hi>

                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>jſs. <hi>fiat cataplaſma, quod applicetur parti affectae mane &amp; veſperi.</hi> IJ. You muſt not force out either the tent armed, or the Trochisk, before they pop out of their owne accord: for ſo they bring the Callus out with them, and the tent with the Callus will repreſent a finger within a glove. If there bee many ſinuofities, yet doe not pierce to any remarkable cavitie, as of the breſt and belly, then you are to diſſolve theſe powders in ſome liquor, as in <hi>Aqua calcis,</hi> Plantane water, Metheglin, a gentle Lee, Allome
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16145:91"/>water, or Vitriol water. Alchymiſts exceedingly commend in this caſe the ſpirit of Niter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way to remove a Callus by an actuall Caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is an invention of <hi>ab Aquapendente:</hi> He will have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument like to a ſetting Iron to bee made, the caſe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the wideneſſe and length of the Fiſtula, and to bee thruſt into the bottome of the Fiſtula, then muſt the other round Iron fill the cavitie of this, toward the point onely, and be round an inch long, and bee put in red hot. It is not to ſtay long where paine is cauſed, becauſe there is no Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus; but to be rubbed up and downe where the place is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent, untill paine be cauſed by reaſon of the removing of the Callus by the fire. And although hee highly commend actuall ſire, and diſcommend the potentiall; yet I am not of his minde in ſundrie caſes: As for this invention, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall goe about to practiſe it, I ſhall hold him much like to him who is to throw at a Cock blind-folded.</p>
               <p>The third Chirurgicall Intention is, to mundifie the part:<note place="margin">3. Intention.</note> this medicament will performs this: ℞ <hi>Vini albi.</hi> 
                  <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſs. <hi>Vnguent. Aegyptiaci</hi> ℥ ſs. <hi>Spirit. vini,</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj. <hi>miſc.</hi> Inject this this warme, but once a day. You ſhall conjecture that the Fiſtula is ſufficiently mundified, if the quittour have no ill ſmell, if it be uniforme, thick, and white.</p>
               <p>Then you are to addreſſe your ſelves to the fourth Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Chirurgicall,<note place="margin">4. Intention.</note> which is to unite and conſolidate the parts disjoyned. To accompliſh this:<note place="margin">The deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidative Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup.</note> firſt draw firſt draw by an Alembick the ſpirit of theſe herbs following, putting ſo much ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water as will bee three inches above the ſimples to them: the roots of <hi>Ariſtolochia rotunda,</hi> Tormentil, Biſtort, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, the leſſer Centorie, <hi>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16145:92"/>Syrup.<note place="margin">The uſe of it.</note> Take two ounces of the ſpirit, and one ounce of the Syrup, which mingle, and inject into the ſinuoſitie, and deale with it as I preſcribed, when I delivered the manner of dreſſing a ſinuous ulcer. If any man deliver a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable way than this to conſolidate a Fiſtula after the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Callus, I ſhall willingly lend him mine eares.</p>
               <p>The last intention chirurgicall is to skin the orifice,<note place="margin">5. Intention.</note> which requireth no new directions. You ſhall know a Fiſtula to bee neere whole, when the humour which floweth is little, thick, concocted, and the place voyd of paine and tumour: If it be altogether dry, you may pronounce the orifice to be skinned, and the Fiſtula perfectly cared.</p>
               <p>From the premiſſes you may gather that foure things hinder the curation of a Fiſtula. I. Is the afflux of a vitious humour. II. Is the narrowneſſe of it, which hardly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the application of convenient medicaments. III. Is the deepneſſe which hindreth the conveighing the medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the bottome. IV. The calloſitie which contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ordinarie medicaments. Seeing I have ſhewed you the way to remove theſe lets and impediments; I hope you will give me leave to conclude this point, of the curation of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulas in generall. In the next Lecture I ſhall diſcourſe of the curation of Fiſtula's in particular places, which when I have done, I will put an end to this Treatiſe of Fiſtula's.</p>

               <p>IN my two laſt Lectures I diſcourſed amply enough of the nature of a Fiſtula, by ſetting downe its deſcription and pathognomonicall or proper ſignes, and the generall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of curing all Fiſtula's indifferently. This only reſteth to be done before I put an end to this point, to ſet downe the curation of ſome particular Fiſtula's differing onely in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16145:92"/>ſubjects, which are the parts wherein they are ſeated, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome ſpeciall directions are required.

               <p>Firſt then I will deale with <hi>Fiſtula lachrymalis,</hi> the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula in the great corner of the eye. In <hi>Paulus Aegineta, De Arte medendi, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 22. there are words in ſound much like <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſignes.</note>The ſignes are manifeſt to the ſenſes: for firſt, the orifice doth offer it ſelfe to the view: ſecondly, by compreſſion the quittour iſſueth out: thirdly, a ſmall probe may bee thruſt within the cavitie to the very end of the Sinus.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Progno. ſticks.</note>As for the Prognoſticks: Firſt then, all theſe Fiſtulas are of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16145:93"/>hard curation, for the moyſtneſſe of the place much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth deſiccation, which is required in the curation of ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Secondly, the part (while one is awake) is in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall motion. Thirdly, by reaſon of the niceneſſe of the part, choyſe of medicaments muſt be had. II. If the quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour hath made way for it ſelfe to the inner paſſage of the noſe, by that hole which paſſeth thorow the bone of the noſe from the corner, then we are only to procure the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of the upper orifice, and not to goe about the ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the bone by a fruitleſſe labour, which will notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding coſt the patient great paine and griefe. III. If a Fiſtula in this place become cancerous, which you ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture by the hard and livid brims, a ſtinging paine, and ſtinking virulent matter, you arc onely to uſe a palliative cure, applying thoſe medicaments which are fit for a cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ulcer, whereof in the curation of a cancer I will ſpeake at large.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The diverſities of theſe Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's.</note>Now to come to the differences of theſe Fiſtula's: Some are maligne, the ſignes whereof I have delivered in the Prognoſticks: Some are not maligne. Of theſe wherein there is no malignitie, ſome are without carioſitie of the bone, and ſome with carioſitie of the bone: you ſhall know that there is no carioſitie of bone: Firſt, if the apoſteme was not long continuing before it brake; for if the tumor was firſt an Oedema Scirrhodes, and continued a long time ſo before it brake, then it is likly that the humor corrupted the bone before it brake. Secondly, if the probe reſt not upon a part hard and rugged. Thirdly, if after dilation of the Fiſtula, the carioſitie bee not preſented to the ſight. If circumſtances contrarie to theſe be offered, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that there is a carioſitie in the bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The curation.</note>To haſten to the curation of theſe Fiſtula's: If a <hi>Fiſtula
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:16145:93"/>lachrymalis,</hi> without corruption of the bone, bee offered to you to be cured, proceed after this manner. Firſt of all, you are to dilate it: ſecondly, you are to remove the calloſitie: thirdly, you are to mundifie it: fourthly, you are to conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate it: and laſtly, to cicatrize it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The manner of dilatation.</note>You ſhall dilate it by the Fiſtula tent framed (as I taught in my former Lecture) according to the proportion of the ſinuoſitie in the beginning: then you ſhall enlarge it more by ſpunges prepared with the Melilot Emplaſter, which I likewayes ſet downe, when I taught here laſt. This manner of dreſſing will diſcover all corners of the ſinuoſitie. The Fiſtula having beene thus dilated, you are to goe about the removing of the Callus. Now in performing this there is not ſo great libertie granted, as is in Fiſtula's of other parts. For firſt, fluid and running meanes having a remarkable acrimonie are not ſafe: for paſſing unto the <hi>Conjunctiva,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Cornea,</hi> they are able to erode it, from whence an ulcer may enſue, and ſo the griefe bee doubled. Secondly, even meanes ſolid carefully muſt be applyed, that they goe no further than the ſinuoſitie of the Fiſtula. It is not unknowne unto you, what horrible ſymptomes often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afflict the eye, by reaſon of a familiar humor only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in degrees of acrimonie: What miſchiefe then is to be expected, if heterogeneall bodies, endued with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie ſharpneſſe, as theſe muſt be which remove a Callus, doe ſeiſe upon the membranes of the eye, adjacent unto the part affected.</p>
               <p>Some there are who cure theſe lachrymall Fiſtula's with liquid medicaments, as with the water of Elder, or Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woort flowers; in everie pint of theſe diſſolving two drams of Mercurie ſublimate, or more, according to the hardneſſe of the calloſitie. The proportion of mixture you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture by the continuance of the Fiſtula, by the age of the partie, and conſtitution of the body. If therefore a Fiſtula be offered to be cured in a body young, of a ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and of a tender conſtitution, then the water is to bee
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16145:94"/>mild; if contrarie conditions doe offer themſelves, then you are to make it more ſtrong, according to diſcretion. If you take two parts of Plantane water, and one part of the ſpirit of Niter, you ſhall have an excellent Topick according to the principles of the Chymiſts.</p>
               <p>One thing is to bee obſerved,<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> that theſe liquid medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bee ſparingly applyed to the ſinuoſitie, that no part of them touch the membranes, to avoyd the accidents whereof I ſpake before.</p>

               <p>If in an Aegilops or lachrymal Fiſtula the bone of the

Peruſe all who have written of the curing of this kinde of Fiſtula, and you ſhall finde that all with one accord ſubſcribe to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall cauterie.</p>
               <p>The actuall cauterie muſt repreſent in figure the ſtone of an Olive: The parts adjacent muſt bee defended from the fire, either by an hollow plate according to <hi>Parrey,</hi> or a cane according to <hi>Ab aqua pendente:</hi> you may make choyſe of which you will: you muſt effectually impreſſe it, to drie the humiditie, and the ſooner to procure the ſcaling of the bone. And although Authors, after the application of the actuall cauterie, preſcribe fattie things to haſten the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the eſchar, yet I adviſe you not to uſe them; for the part is moyſt of it ſelfe, and ſo the application of ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments would procure a ſordid ulcer: Apply therefore onely pledgets, or tents dipped in red wine, and above all <hi>Diapalma,</hi> or <hi>Emplaſtrum de Minio,</hi> or <hi>de Smegmate.</hi> When the bone hath caſt a ſcale, then conſolidate and skin it, as I have ſet downe before.</p>
               <p>It is not unknowne unto you, with what difficultie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients admit the application of an actuall cauterie, to a part much diſtant from any of the principall, and wherein there is but ſmall ſenſibilitie. What will a patient troubled with this griefe doe, if you make mention of cauterization to be made in this place, ſo neere the eye and the braine it ſelfe? If at any time you make mention of ſuch a kinde of curati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a patient, to try how hee doth ſtand affected to this operation; let me entreat you not to urge it too much, as if the cure of the Fiſtula could not otherwayes bee compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if you finde the patient averſe, leſt you drive him away, and ſo you loſe both credit and gaine. When in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey I practiſed Chirurgerie, ſundrie times this kinde of griefe having beene preſented unto me, I ever found the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ſtrucken into a terrour and amaſement, as ſoone as
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16145:95"/>mention was made of cauterization; wherefore I ſet my imagination at worke, to finde out a way to cure a <hi>Fiſtula lachrymalis,</hi> leſſe, terrible, but more ſure and effectuall, which I will not conceale from you, becauſe this griefe doth often come to your hands, and both great credit and gaine is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by performing the curation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">My manner of curing Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logs.</note>My manner of curation is this: Firſt of all, having with a ſmall probe bended, found out the cavitie both upwards and downewards, I draw a line with inke betweene the Glandule of the eye, &amp; the Trochlea or the pulley, through which the ſmall tendon of the firſt oblique muſcule called <hi>ſuperior,</hi> or <hi>major,</hi> the uppermoſt and greateſt paſſeth, and endeth obliquely in the uppermoſt part of <hi>Cornea:</hi> then I make inciſion to the bone; the part inciſed I divide with the nailes of the fore-fingers, untill the inciſed bee ſo much dilated, that it will without difficultie admit a prettie pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get: this being done, I thruſt in a ſmall Trochiske made of the Turbith minerall before it be waſhed, the vomitive Vitriol, and the beſt <hi>Terra ſigillata</hi> wrought with <hi>Populeum</hi> to the forme of a ſtiffe paſte, and afterward dried. About the Trochisk I apply a pledget armed with <hi>Populeum,</hi> which I keepe to the Fiſtula by an Emplaſter of <hi>Diapalma cum ſuccis,</hi> malaxed with the oyle of Henbane. Afterward fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the orbit of the eye with little bolſters made of ſoft lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen-cloth folded, and moyſtened in <hi>Aqua ſpermati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ranarum caphurata,</hi> I rowle up the eye. Theſe ſame dreſſings I uſe morning and evening, untill the Trochisk with the Callus fall out of it owne accord: which when I perceive, I dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently view the bone, to ſee how much is carious: unto it I apply the powder of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> if the diſeaſed partie be aged, and of a firme conſtitution of body; but if the partie be young, and of a tender conſtitution, I beſprinkle the bone with <hi>Pulvis Cephalicus.</hi> The cavitie of the part inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed I fill up with a peece of the ſpunge dreſſed with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilot Emplaſter, as I delivered in my former Lecture: about it I apply a pledget armed with <hi>Populeum,</hi> all which I couch
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16145:95"/>downe cloſe, with the emplaſter and bolſters kept to the eye with a rowler.</p>
               <p>This manner of dreſſing I continue untill the ſcale of the carious bone caſt, which moſt commonly falleth out about the twentieth day. When the ſcale is removed, I mundifie the part with <hi>Mel roſatum,</hi> or <hi>Melrutaceum,</hi> then I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure conſolidation by the Syrup of Mirtles, or of the red Roſes dried. And laſt of all I cicatrize the part affected with ſome epuloticall Emplaſter, whereof I have ſet downe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſtore heretofore, and ſhall hereafter when I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of an ulcer which hardly admitteth skinning. I have made ſufficient experiment of this manner of curing an Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilops in ſundrie perſons. And I truly affirme, that I never miffed of the cure of any one with whom I thus dealt: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall you (I hope) if punctually you obſerve theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations in your proceedings.</p>

                  <note place="margin">When the bone of the noſe is to be pierced.</note>It may fall out that the whole ſubſtance of the bone of the noſe ſubjacent to the Fiſtula may be carious, being of it owne nature thin, and the head of the partie beſides verie rheumatick, ſo that being often cured in the opinion both of the Chirurgeon and diſcaſed partie, yet it doth breake out againe. In ſuch a caſe you may demand of mee, how you ſhall fall off from ſuch a cure with your owne credit. To this I anſwer, that there is yet a Subterfuge, and a way left to give contentment to the afflicted patient: To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe this, firſt dilate againe the ſinuoſitie, untill the corrupt bone appeare, as hath beene ſhewed heretofore: Secondly, pierce the bone of the noſe with a gimlet, that the quittor may have recourſe to the noſthrils, which are appointed as ſhoares to diſcharge the flegmatike excrements of the braine, and to draw in freſh aire for the refrigeration of the lungs: &amp; then cure the ſuperjacent fleſhie and skinnie parts, as I taught you, when I ſet downe the palliative manner to cure a Fiſtula. This manner of curation being the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, it will undoubtedly give contentment to the patient: for the eyes of the beholders ſhall obſerve no deformitie

                  <note place="margin">How it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</note>This kinde of Fiſtula happeneth by two manner of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:16145:96"/>wayes: Firſt, by reaſon of a penetrating wound of the breſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by a Phlegmon poſſeſſing the intercoſtall Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, and the Pleura.</p>
               <p>It is a ſuperfluous matter to ſet downe any ſignes, ſeeing they appeare to the eye, and are eaſily found out by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſignes ſet downe in the generall method of curing of Fiſtula's, to every Fiſtula in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>As for the differences, a Fiſtula enſuing a wound pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating to the cavity of the breſt, hath but one orifice, the paſſage and ſinewoſity whereof is according to the penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wound; but a Fiſtula following after an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme hath frequently more orifices than one, whereof ſome paſſe to the cavity of the breſt directly, ſome windingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note>To come to the Preſages. All Fiſtula's of the breſt are hard to be cured, and that for ſeven reaſons; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> for firſt, the breſt is in continuall motion by reaſon of its dilatation and contraction cauſed by the intercoſtall Muſcules: now that motion hindereth the curation of any ſore, it is ſo manifeſt, and confirmed by experience, that it needeth no probation.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, becauſe in penetrating Fiſtula's of the breſt, the Pleura is alwayes ulcerate; which being thin, without bloud, and membranous, as the bladder hardly admitteth any conſolidation.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, ſeeing the <hi>Virus</hi> of the Fiſtula doth often cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the rib; and ſeeing the internall ſubſtance of the rib is cavernous, and ſo apt to lodge corrupt matter, the difficulty of curing is increaſed.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, in Fiſtula's of the breſt, the end of the Fiſtula is often lower than the orifice, which hindereth the expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the ſuperfluous matter.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Fifthly, the ſinewoſity within, in penetrating Fiſtula's doth frequently extend it ſelfe betweene the Pleura and the upper rib, to the diſtance betweene it and the lower rib. Now how hard a matter it is to cleanſe this cavity, I referre it to your owne conſideration.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:16145:97"/>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Sixthly, that liberty of applying of medicaments, which is permitted in ſundry other parts of the body, is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; the lungs and heart being lodged in this cavity, whereof ſpeciall regard is to be had, ſeeing from the ſafety of theſe parts the life of the <hi>Individuum</hi> dependeth.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> Seventhly, becauſe theſe Fiſtula's bring an extenuation of the body, and a Hectick fever.</p>
               <p>Let this be the ſecond Prognoſtick: If the party afflicted with a Fiſtula in the breſt be fallen unto a Hectick fever,<note place="margin">2.

Yea, ſuch plenty of ſharpe humors ſometimes floweth to theſe parts, that perforation of the guts is cauſed, and that the excrements come out at the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Fiſtula; a lamentable caſe, noiſome to the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed party, and intolerable to the company.

               <p>As for Inciſion and Deligation; they have place when the Fiſtula is ſhallow, but if the Fiſtula be deepe, neither of theſe meanes are to be attempted.</p>

As for the threed wherewith you are to binde the <hi>ſinus,</hi> two I commend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; firſt, ſealing threed, which is made of the beſt hemp, unboyled, and unwhitned: for it is exceeding ſtrong, and will not rot before it hath wrought its effect. The ſecond, is a ſtrong threed of ſilke, twiſted; there is no great matter in the colour, whatſoever ſcrupulous Authors affirme: you may uſe either of theſe as opportunity ſhall be offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The manner: of binding.</note>When you goe about to binde the <hi>ſinus,</hi> put in one end of the threed in the eye of a ſmall and flexible probe, then thruſt the eye with the threed thorow the <hi>ſinus</hi> into <hi>Inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num rectum:</hi> this being done, put into the <hi>Anus</hi> your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and with it pull the threed out of the eye of the probe, and draw it out at the <hi>Anus,</hi> or having bent the eye of the probe, bring it without the <hi>Anus;</hi> and then putting the threed into the eye, draw that end thorow the outer ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Fiſtula, If the <hi>ſinus</hi> be not very thick and long, you may by one ſtrong deligation binde off all the <hi>ſinus,</hi> but if the <hi>ſinus</hi> be thick and long, you muſt uſe ſundry conſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, tying ſtill the ends of the threed with a running
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16145:104"/>knot, that it may be the more readily looſed. Some after one deligation onely, more and more draw in the ends of the threed, with a round piece of a ſticke turned about. When all the <hi>ſinus</hi> after diviſion, by deligation, lieth open, goe forward in the cure, as hath beene ſet downe when the <hi>ſinus</hi> was inciſed. Now nothing remaineth to conclude theſe diſcourſes of Fiſtula's, but to ſpeake ſomewhat of the curing of the Fiſtula's in the joynts. Theſe griefes, what paines they procure to the Patients, and troubles to the Chirurgeons who dreſſe them, it is ſo well knowne to thoſe who have beene imployed in ſuch buſineſſes, that I need not to uſe many words to perſwade any to beleeve this: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience bearing witneſſe.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The differences of theſe Fiſtula's are theſe. Some are without corruption of the bones and cartilages, and ſome have theſe annexed.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, ſome of theſe are without any tumor of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts, and in ſome there is a remarkable ſwelling of the parts adjacent; ſo that the skin it ſelfe is either brawny and hard, or looſe and <hi>oedematus;</hi> and ſome of the tendons of the muſcules are foule, and corrupted very often: ſuch tumors often fall out, when Fiſtula's happen in the wriſts and anckles.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in ſome of theſe Fiſtula's the joynt abideth firme, but in ſome it becommeth looſe and weake, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the relaxation of the membrane which covereth it, and the ligament by the which it is ſtrengthened.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The manner of ſearching.</note>Before I come to prognoſticate of the events, let me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with one thing, and that is this; that if you bee called to children or young perſons troubled with a Fiſtula, or Fiſtula's in the joynt or joynts, that you make triall of the <hi>ſinus</hi> with a Mallow ſtalke anſwerable to it: for this kinde of probation is of all others leſſe painfull, and will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the diſeaſed perſons to commit themſelves to you care, when they perceive that you ſearched the ſores ſo eaſir hoping that your proceedings will be according to you-beginning.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The preſage.</note>As for the preſages: I. No Fiſtula of the joynt, although it be without corruption of the cartilages or bones, is of an eaſie curation: for firſt by reaſon of the paine which is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by reaſon of ſenſibleneſſe of the part, and the increaſe of it by reaſon of the ſharpe medicaments which muſt be applied to remove the Callus, ſymptomaticall ſevers, loſſe of appetite, watching, and at laſt extenuation of the body; and at laſt a Hectick fever may be procured.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If a Fiſtula of the elbow or knee, have corruption, either of the cartilages or bones annexed, it will require a long time to have it cured: for the joynts themſelves being very ſenſible, it muſt be gently dreſſed.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If in Fiſtula's of the wriſt, the bones of it, or of the backe of the hand, be carious, you ſhall finde the cure to be difficult: for theſe bones are very ſpungeous, apt to receive ſuperfluous humidity, and ſo are hard to be ſcaled.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. For theſe ſame reaſons, the bones of the joynt of the foot and the inſtep are hard to be cured.</p>
               <p n="5">V. If Fiſtula's in the wriſt or inſtep be accompanied with large and hard tumors of the hands and feet, pronounce the cure to be uncurable: for then the membranes, tendons of the muſcules, and bones moſt commonly are corrupt.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. If an extenuation of the body, or a Hectick fever doe accompany Fiſtula's in the great joynts, ſhun the cure: for the indications of curing, which preſcribe drying and cooling, in drying increaſe theſe griefes. Beſides this, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate diſeaſes are more hardly cured than thoſe which are ſolitary.</p>
               <p>If you ſhall demand of mee,<note place="margin">Object.</note> what courſe is to be taken with thoſe who are poſſeſſed with ſuch uncurable Fiſtula's, if you bee intreated of the diſeaſed party, or the parties friends to doe your beſt?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that if after ſome triall,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> you perceive the party
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16145:105"/>to be uncurable, you ought to move the party to ſuffer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirpation, and diſmembring of the limme, whether it bee foot or arme, before he grow weake, and become unable to endure any ſuch operation.

                  <note place="margin">The Topicall meanes of the moderne Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons.</note>The moderne and neoterick Chirurgeons, not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with theſe, have found out other meanes not inferiour to theſe: The one is Mercuric precipitate, firſt nobilitate by <hi>Iohn de Vico,</hi> and fithence his time much uſed by all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Chirurgeons. This powder being waſhed with Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane and Roſe-water, and mingled with ſarcoticall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, doth admirably heale rheumatick ulcers in tender perſons. If it being unwaſhed be mingled with alome cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined, taking <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. of it, and <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. of Alome, it is a cathereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call medicament, and fit to be applied to foule and ſpreading ulcers, ſuch as <hi>Herpes exedens,</hi> Phagedaena, and Nome are. The other medicament invented by the late Chymiſts, is the Turbith minerall precipitate by the oyle of ſulphur, or Vitrioll; it is now much uſed both in the practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick &amp; Chirurgeric; it is miniſtred with good ſucceſſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons infected with the Neapolitane lues; if they have either <hi>Cephalas Gallica,</hi> extreme paines in their heads, or venereall
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16145:108"/>ulcers. As for the uſe of it in the practice of Chirurgery, I dare aſcribe to my ſelfe the invention of it (in theſe parts) without ſuſpition of any arrogancie. After that is precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and calcined, it is very white, and is an excellent eſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioticall medicament, farre ſurpaſſing either Mercurie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate or Arſenick: for it is more ſafe, and is not ſo painfull: beſides this, it doth not cauſe ſuch inflammations as theſe do, neither doth it procure ſo promptly ſymptomaticall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Being waſhed, it is uſed to work theſe effefts which Mercurie precipitate doth, but much more effectually.

You are to continue the uſe of theſe topicall meanes, untill the ulcer ſpread no more, and be red, and very cleane.

Theſe late writers, in the number of whom are <hi>Gordonius, Buyrus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aleſcus de Taranta, Ioannes de Vigo, Petrus de Argelata, Guido de Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaco,</hi> and ſundrie others, who lived in our fore-fathers times, when barbarouſneſſe had exiled eloquence, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance learning: and when all liberall Arts and Sciences had ſuffered a ſtrange and fearefull eclips, although they ſet downe ſometimes medicaments not to bee rejected; yet I would not have you to truſt much to their diſcourſes, or to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16145:110"/>labour to imitate their phraſes. And as the Arabian Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians doe farre exceed theſe, ſo the Grecians are to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto the Arabians in their diſcourſes, although they come not neere unto the Arabians in ſeeting downe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for the griefes.</p>
               <p>If you conſider either the varietie or pleaſantneſſe of them: for many ages together here in the Weſt, <hi>Hippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Galen, Paulus Aegineta, Oribaſins, Alexander Trallianus,</hi> and the reſt of the Greeke Authors lay unreſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and the Arabians only were in requeſt, although moſt rudely and barbarouſly tranſlated; which no judicious and impartiall Preader of their monuments will or can deny. Wherefore concerning theſe griefes, I will deliver unto you what the Grecians, the parents of Phyſicke, and all other liberall Arts and Sciences, have delivered methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: As for the medicaments which are to be applyed, I will pick out the beſt, which either the ancient or the moderne writers have revealed to us: neither will I conceale from you what I have found effectuall in mine owne practice.</p>

So that Phagedaena is framed of the ulcer and the tumor. <hi>Herpes</hi> in like manner doth erode the parts about it; but it reſteth in the skin onely: but Phage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daena doth extend it ſelfe as well to the ſubjacent parts as to the skin. But it is to no purpoſe to call ulcers Chironian, or Telephian. It is ſufficient to call all ſuch ulcers <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligna:</hi> that is, of an ill condition or qualitie. By this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16145:111"/>of <hi>Galen</hi> tranſlated by mee, you may gather three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that in a Phagedaena there is an eroſion not onely of the skin; but of the fleſhy parts ſubjacent alſo, by the which it is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Herpes exedens,</hi> or <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica ambulativa,</hi> whereof I diſcourſed in my former Lecture.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that in a Phagedaena there is a tumor in the brims of the ulcer, whereas there is none in a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or a conſuming ulcer, called by Latine Authors <hi>Vlcus depaſcens,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>Vlcus exedens,</hi> an eating ulcer.</p>
               <p>The third is, that the denomination of Chironian and Telephian ulcers, doe onely ſignifie maligne ulcers in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; but no ſpeciall kinde of ulcer in particular. In <hi>Paulus Aegineta de art. medend. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 46. bearing this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ulcers of an evill condition, which are called Chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian and Telephian by Phyſicians: theſe words are read as I have tranſlated them. Old and inveterate ulcers, which hardly admit skinning, which are named <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne, ſome call Chironian, as if they did require the hand of the Centaure <hi>Chiron,</hi> the moſt excellent in the Art of curing: others call them Telephian, ſuch as <hi>Telephus</hi> was troubled with, which require the helpfull hand of <hi>Achilles,</hi> who cured him. So hee jumpeth with <hi>Galen,</hi> that theſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles were aſcribed to all maligne ulcers; but did point at no particular kinde of ulcer.</p>
               <p>Now it cannot be amiſſe briefly to ſhew unto you what men <hi>Chiron</hi> and <hi>Telephus</hi> were, ſeeing they are ſo famouſly recorded by the Poets: They who are Scholers amongſt you, cannot but be delighted when the ſtudies of the youth are brought to remembrance.<note place="margin">Chiron.</note> 
                  <hi>Chiron</hi> then was one of the Centaures, which were a people who inhabited the places neere to Pelion, the hill of Theſſaly. Theſe firſt began to breake great horſes, and to fight on horſe-back: wherefore the neighbouring people, when it firſt ſaw them, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to bee ſtrange creatures, compoſed and framed

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in Greeke is an hand. He taught <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> the Art of curing: <hi>Pelcus, Achilles</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was his ſonne in law, of whoſe daughter <hi>Thetis</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſo much commended for valour and ſtrength by the Heathen Poets. He taught <hi>Achilles</hi> being his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, Chirurgerie, playing upon the Citherne, and horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip. The two kindes of Centorie, the greater and the leſſer, <hi>Centaurium majus &amp; minus,</hi> are named of him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is great uſe in the practice both of Phyſick and Chirurgerie. It is like that hee was fortunate in the curing of maligne ulcers, by reaſon of the great skill which he had in the knowledge of the facultie of plants. Hee lived but 2690. yeares after the creation of the world, that is, 77. yeares before the deſtruction of Troy, which fell out <hi>Anno mundi</hi> 2767. Then 2685. yeares are expired ſithence fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Chiron</hi> lived. This may ſerve to prove the antiquitie of Chirurgerie. Poſteritie for his worth named the ninth ſigne of the Zodiack <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> who ruleth the thighs, from him: From whence <hi>

               </q>
               <p>By this we may gather how vertue and learning were regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the rude and ſimple ages, which are verie little eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in theſe civill times, wherein moſt men are given to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their pleaſures, which will coſt them too deare, when the generall accompt ſhall be made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Telephus</hi> was one of <hi>Hercules</hi> his ſonnes,<note place="margin">Telephus.</note> who being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted by the King of Myſia who then reigned, after his death ſucceeded him in government. When he would have hindred the Grecians marching towards Troy, from paſſing
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:16145:112"/>thorow his countrey, in combat he was wounded by <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;</hi> but afterward being reconciled to <hi>Achilles,</hi> he was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him, hee mingling with either an unguent or a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſme, (for <hi>Malagma</hi> ſignifieth both) the ruſt of his ſpeare, and it is not unlikely; for there is none here (as I ſuppoſe) who knoweth not the facultie of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> in cicatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of rheumatike ulcers, it drying ſtrongly without any ſharpneſſe; unto which the ruſt of old iron waſhed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared commeth verie neere. So <hi>Achilles</hi> made ſufficient proofe of his skill in the Art of Chirurgerie, which he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of his grand-father <hi>Chiron.</hi> Goe to then, let effeminate Hind-calves deſpiſe the Art of Chirurgerie, which ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a perſon as <hi>Achilles</hi> was, was not aſhamed to practiſe. From <hi>Achilles</hi> Millefole is called <hi>Sideritis Achillea, Achilles</hi> his Star-woort: and it may bee that it was one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ingredients of the cataplaſme: ſurely it is an excellent healing plant. To conclude then this point: maligne ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers who are not eaſily cured, are called <hi>Chironia,</hi> becauſe <hi>Chiron</hi> was able to cure them, and <hi>Telephia</hi> becauſe <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> was troubled long with ſuch an one.</p>
               <p>Now time calleth to goe forward in the handling of theſe corroſive ulcers: but before I ſet downe the manner of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, the predictions of the events which are like to fall out in the courſe of curation are firſt to be ſet downe. I.<note place="margin">Preſages.</note> Neither of both theſe corroſive ulcers are of eaſie curation, what body ſoever they light upon; and for three cauſes: for firſt, there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an ill conſtitution and temperature of the part, by the which the aliment which is ſent to the part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be good, is corrupted. Secondly, a freſh ſupply of noxious humors is ſent moſt commonly to maintaine the griefe. Thirdly, becauſe the ordinarie medicaments which are applyed with good ſucceſſe moſt commonly to other ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, in theſe ulcers are ineffectuall. II. If theſe ulcers light upon a cacochymicall body, the caſe is yet worſe: for the conſtitution of the body muſt be altered before theſe griefes can be cured, which is a matter of no ſmall difficultie. III. If
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:16145:113"/>theſe ſeize upon decrepit perſons, the caſe is in a manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate: for in ſuch the naturall heat is weake, and the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call moyſture almoſt ſpent: ſo that great ſtore of corrupt and ſaltiſh humors are bred in the bodies of ſuch, which being ſent to the weak parts ulcerate, increaſe theſe griefes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The intentions of curing.</note>The curation is performed by three meanes: to wit, a convenient diet, internall medicaments, and locall applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: As for the diet,<note place="margin">Dict.</note> thoſe meats and drinks muſt be uſed which afford a laudable juyce; whereof I have ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and in that meaſure that the naturall heat may bee able to concoct them, that no ſuperfluities be bred. Beſides this, meats which are eaſily corrupted in the ſtomack are to be ſhunned, as milk meats, ſummer fruits, and ſalt meats: ſlimie fiſhes, and Swines fleſh are to be ſhunned, becauſe they afford no good nouriſhment.</p>

A Cancer in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is hardly diſcerned: for the ſymptomes are but mild, and ſometimes it is no bigger than a peaſe, or a beane, or a filbert-nut. II. It is hard, by reaſon of the thickneſſe of the humor, which withſtandeth the touch. III. It is of a leady colour, repreſenting the colour of the humor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is bred, yea the more maligne it is, the more livid and black it appeareth. IV. The tumor is verie painfull: Firſt, becauſe <hi>Atra bilis</hi> the materiall cauſe of it is hot: Secondly, becauſe no heat can breath out, the ſubſtance of the Cancer being ſo compact. V. It is round, becauſe the matter being thick, is not ſo apt to fleet abroad. VI. It is unequall, by reaſon of the ebullition of the humor, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is not equally active in all parts of the tumor. Laſt of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:16145:116"/>all, a Cancer bath black or livid veines extended to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts; for this atrabilious humor cannot ſweat out of the veines, which is the cauſe that they appeare verie full.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Why it doth poſſeſſe the breſt.</note>The breſts moſt promptly receive this atrabilious humor, becauſe they are of glandulous and looſe ſubſtance: Beſides, the <hi>Mammariae</hi> veines meet with the <hi>Vterinae</hi> under the ſtraight muſcules of the belly; ſo that the matrix may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it ſelfe of aduſt and feculent melancholy bloud by regurgitation, which may cauſe a Cancer if it paſſe to the dugs.</p>

Of the Leproſie and a leprous ulcer.</head>
               <p>NOw followeth the ſecond kinde of ulcers moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne; to wit, a leprous ulcer. But firſt of all, I will diſcourſe of the Leproſie it ſelfe, and then of the nature of a leprous ulcer.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The names of it.</note>The Leproſie in the Greeke and Latine tongue is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſquama,</hi> or <hi>cortex,</hi> a ſcale or bark, becauſe it ſendeth our ſcales, &amp; maketh the skin rough like to the bark of a tree.<note place="margin">The divers kindes of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſity.</note> There be two ſorts of leproſity: to wit, the Grecian and Arabian Leproſie.</p>
               <p>The Grecian leproſity may be thus deſcribed: It is a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor with a confirmed hot any dry diſtemperature of the skin, both in the outer and inner part of it, wherein ſcales, like thoſe of fiſhes, are ſent out: ſo that <hi>Pruritus, Scabies,</hi> and <hi>Lepra Graecorum,</hi> the itch, ſcabbineſſe, and the Graecian leproſity differ onely in degrees of tumifaction, and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The difference between itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſcabbines, and the Greeke leproſie.</note>In itching there is no remarkable tumor, neither doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing fall away from the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> unleſſe it be fetched away by hard ſcratching. In ſcabbineſſe there is a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tumor, and whether we ſcartch or no, both ſanious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſcales like to the caſt skin of a ſnake. In the Graecian Leproſie, there are greater tumors than in ſcabbines, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies like unto the ſcales of fiſhes, fall from ſuch as are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with this griefe: ſo that <hi>Avenzoar</hi> fitly calleth ſcabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <hi>Pruritum veſicalem,</hi> a bliſtery or powckie itching, but
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16145:119"/>the Graecian leproſity <hi>Pruritum ſquamoſum,</hi> a ſcaly itching.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſignes.</note>The ſignes of this Leproſie are theſe: the skin is dry, rough, and full of ſmall knobs, which itch exceedingly, and ſendeth out bodies like to the ſcales of fiſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The cauſes.</note>The cauſes of it, are either the externall efficient cauſes, or the internall materiall.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The efficient.</note>The externall efficient, are I. unwholeſome meats and drinks.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Slovenlineſſe, ſluttiſhneſſe, and filthineſſe. <hi>Serenus</hi> the poeticall Phyſician hath compriſed theſe two cauſes learnedly in two Hexameter verſes thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Illotus ſudor &amp; inopia nobilis eſcae</l>
                  <l>Sape gravi ſcabie correptos aſperat artus.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Sweat not waſhed away, and want of good food, often doe make rough the lims, being taken with noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſcabbineſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The menſtruall courſes, or hemorrhodes which were wont to flow, being ſuppreſſed, may cauſe this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Fontanells which have long beene kept open, being ſhut up may procure the ſame.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Varices,</hi> the veines tumified by reaſon of melancholy bloud, being cured, ſometimes are the cauſes of this griefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The materiall cauſe.</note>The materiall cauſes are diſcerned by the colour of the griefe: for if the knobs bee of a livid or leady colour, ſuperfluous impure melancholy is the cauſe; if they be white, or of a grayiſh colour, then ſalt flegme is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which is mingled with melancholy: and becauſe aged perſons multiply ſalt flegme, they are often troubled with this griefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The preſages,</note>As for the Preſages, let this be the firſt: this griefe if it be habituall, and of a long continuance, it is not eaſily cured.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if it be neglected, it may turne to the Leproſie of the Arabians.</p>

               <p>pointed for them: for thorowout the whole yeere they eat cabbage ſalted, much cheeſe, old butter, and fleſh dryed in the ſmoke, but moſt of all bacon. In like manner it is fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Aegypt: becauſe there they eat much aſſes-fleſh, and drink ſtanding and corrupt waters, if you except thoſe who inhabit places neere to Nilus. <hi>Lucretius</hi> learnedly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de natur. rerum.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Eſt Elephas morbus qui propter ſtumina Nili</l>
                  <l>Gignitur, Aegypti inmedio, neque praterea uſquam.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The Leproſie is a diſeaſe which is bred by the River of Nilus, in the middle of Aegypt, and no where elſe.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that <hi>Moſes</hi> threateneth the diſobedient Iewes thus, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>The Lord will ſmite thee with the botch of Aegypt, and with the emerods, and with the ſcab, and with the itch, whereof thou canſt not be healed.</hi> In the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Text, it is with the ulcer of Aegypt, whereby is meant the Leproſie; by the ſcab, he meaneth the Greeke Leproſie, whereof I have ſpoken. In Spaine and Africk it is more common than any where elſe. In the Province of France, Delphinat, Languedock, and in Aquitane it is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than in other parts of the countrey, <hi>Paraeus l.</hi> 19. <hi>ca.</hi> 6. Before the time of <hi>Pompey</hi> it was not ſeene in Italy, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth <hi>Plin. nat. hiſt. l.</hi> 26. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Leproſie may be taken by having carnall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation with an infected perſon, ſee <hi>Gordon. l. wed. particul.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 22. and <hi>Philippus Schopfius</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Arabians, <hi>Avicen, Albucaſis,</hi> and <hi>Averoes,</hi> think that if a woman conceive while her courſes flow, the childe will prove leprous, but it is not likely: for that bloud in ſound women is good, and after conception it is retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to nouriſh the childe: ſo that if that bloud were vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous (as ſome think) no man or woman could be ſound.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:16145:120"/>
               <p>Fourthly, this diſeaſe being often heredetary, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate from the parents to the children.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, continuall converſation with leprous perſons cannot be but very dangerous, for if one may become <hi>Pthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> by often receiving the breath of one who is troubled with that griefe, according to Glaſſick Authors, much more may one be infected by receiving the aire infected with the breath of a leprous perſon, which is moſt corrupt and ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: wherefore lazarous perſons, in every well ordered place, dwell by themſelves, that they infect not others; and ſo God himſelfe commaded, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.4. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The materiall cauſe and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of the Leproſie.</note>The internall materiall cauſe, by all is concluded to be <hi>Bilis atra.</hi> Now ſeeing this humor is cauſed of three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall humors altered from their naturall qualities, three kindes of Leproſie doe ſpring.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is cauſed of the ſuperfluous melancholy juyce burned; this Leproſie cauſeth the skin to be of a ruddie black colour: this kinde of leproſity commeth on but ſlowly, and hath milder ſymptomes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is of yellow vitelline choler aduſt: This ſpeedily corrupteth the inner parts, chiefly the liver and ſpleene, and from thence palling furiouſly to the habit of the body, produceth horrible ſymptomes: in this kinde of Leproſie the skin is of a yellowiſh colour, tending to greene.</p>
               <p>The third is cauſed of ſalt or nitrous flegme burned: In this the colour is a paliſh white colour, the Leproſie which is cauſed of this humor, is not ſo fierce as the former. There be two other differences taken from the progreſſion of the diſeaſe: for a Leproſie is either in the beginning, or conſummate.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſignes of the Leproſie beginning.</note>The ſignes of a Leproſie beginning, are theſe: The face ſeemeth to be of a livid reddiſh colour, the breathing is with ſome difficulty, the voyce ſeemeth to be ſomewhat hoarſe, livid ſpots appeare in ſundry parts of the body, the skin beginneth to looſe its exquiſite feeling, the urine is muddy

The skin loſeth altogether its feeling, ſo that you may thruſt a needle thorow it, without any offence to the diſeaſed party; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> this happeneth becauſe the humor, by reaſon of its thickneſſe, ſtoppeth the ſinewes, and ſo hindereth the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall ſpirit to paſſe.

               <p>Now it is time to addreſſe my ſelfe to the Prognoſticks, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> wherof this ſhal be the firſt: A leproſie in the very beginning is hardly cured, for the materiall cauſe of it is <hi>Atrabilis:</hi> now all diſeaſe? of <hi>Bili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now the meanes of curing a Leproſie beginning,<note place="margin">The meanes of curing.</note> are three: Dieteticall, Pharmaceuticall, and Chirurgicall.</p>

Theſe are not ſo hot as either eſcatoricall, or ſeptick medicants, and thoſe which bliſter: yet hot they are, and burne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though gently; being then hot and dry in the fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, they are of a thick and aſtringent ſubſtance: wherefore ſuch medicaments pierce not deepe, partly by reaſon of their thick ſubſtance, partly by reaſon of their rebated heat; wherefore theſe onely ſuperficially dry and corrode the fleſh. Neither doe they cauſe any great paine, becauſe their heat is not very Intenſe, unleſſe they be graduate by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of ſome other things. So we ſee Mercurie preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate, or burned Alome, if either of them be applied to any ſore, to cauſe no great paine; but if they be uſed being mixed, both to cauſe paine, and a ſmall eſchar. Such are Alome calcined, Shels burned, the powder of Hermodactils, Aſphodill, Vergidraſſe, but Mercurie precipitate excelleth, and exceedeth all theſe: for it doth work with ſmall paine, and doth by concoction make thick, thin, and ichorous quittor: yea it being waſhed, and mingled in ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with incarnative unguents, furthereth their operation. The yellow Turbith minerall exceedeth it in faculty, for the oyle of Vitrioll or Sulphur, whereof the Turbith mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall is precipitate, is more familiar to nature, and aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, than the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or <hi>Aqua regis,</hi> whereof the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate is made.</p>

And we ſee that Pepper, Onyons, and ſuch like, although they be hot above the third degree, yet they are not cauſtick; and the reaſon is, becauſe although they inflame, yet becauſe their heat is placed in a thin and ſubtill ſubſtance, it is more eaſily diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and at laſt overcome by the naturall heat of our bodies.</p>

                  <hi>LECT. XX.</hi> Of the ſcaling of corrupt bones.</head>
               <p>Having in my laſt Lecture ſet downe the fountaines from whence all the accidents of ulcers doe ſpring, and having diſcourſed of the manner of curing of an ulcer, wherein there is excreſcenſe of ſuperfluous fleſh, which was ſet downe to be the prime accident flowing from things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature, I muſt be carried to the ſecond accident, proceeding from things according to nature, which is the carioſitie of the bone.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing the bones are the ſtayes and props of the body, appointed not onely for locall motion; but for the parts alſo which further this action, as muſcules, veines, nerves, arteries, I am with the greater care to ſet downe the curation of an ulcer, with the carioſitie of a bone, ſeeing ſo many things of importance doe depend upon the curation of ſuch an ulcer. In running over the whole courſe of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie, I have reſolved upon this firſt triall, to ſet downe onely the generall practices, which they who are judicious may apply to all perſons and parts in ſpeciall. In handling of this accident, I will ſet downe theſe foure points. I. The cauſes which procure the carioſitie of the bones. II. The ſignes of a corrupt bone. III. The prognoſticks or an ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, wherein there is a carioſitie of the bone: And IIII. Of the meanes which are to be uſed for removing of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The cauſes of the corruption of the bones.</note>Now the cauſes which procure the corruption of the bones, are either externall, or internall.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:16145:125"/>The externall cauſes are two, to wit, too great cold,<note place="margin">1. Externall.</note> and too great heat: for as too great cold doth quench the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heat of the bone; ſo immoderate heat, by diſcuſſing the naturall humiditie, drieth and corrupteth the bones.<note place="margin">2. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The internall cauſes which moſt frequently produce this accident, are in number three. The firſt is a glutinous and ſuperfluous humiditie, firſt ſoftning, and then corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the bone, which oftentimes doth cauſe a diſtortion of the member, and a protuberance of the bone, which I have ſundrie times ſeene, and have noted not to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from any venereall cauſe. Such an humor ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one, whoſe name was <hi>Iames Wilkinſon,</hi> who dwelt neere to me when I practiſed in the citie of Cheſter, and cauſed a bending outward of both the ſhin-bones, or <hi>Oſſa tibia:</hi> this happened to him when he was above ſixtie yeares old: neither did this accident either cauſe nocturnall or diurnall paine, or hinder his going. Before this did befall him, hee had a great evacuation of bloud (by reaſon of the rupture of a veſſell in his left kidney) together with his urine, of the which I cured him by the decoction of ſome of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robalans.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The ſecond inward cauſe of the carioſitie of bones, is a ſharp and maligne matter, which by touching doth corrupt the bone: this happened) moſt commonly in old and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate ulcers: the Perioſtium being once croded by the acrimony of the Sanies, it preſently corrupteth the bone. It is no marvell that a ſharp humor is able to corrupt bones in other parts of the body, when wee ſee the teeth to bee hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a ſharp rheume, which a file of tempered ſteele doth with ſome difficultie raſe.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The third inward cauſe is an hidden and ſtrange qualifie of the humor, adverſe to the bones, ſeizing not onely upon ſome particular bones, but upon ſome parts alſo of theſe bones: for if it did with any manifeſt qualitie corrupt the bones, it would firſt have eroded the fleſh: this being moſt ſubject to the impreſſion of any fretting humor. But the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:16145:126"/>bones verie often are found to be carious, when the parts covering the bones, as the <hi>Cuticula cutis,</hi> and <hi>Membrana carnoſa</hi> are found whole. So when Nodes invade the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Naples, they appeare moſt commonly in the <hi>Os frontis,</hi> or in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> or <hi>Tibia,</hi> and that betweene the joynts: Who is able to give a demonſtrative reaſon of this invaſion? Hee undoubtedly who is able to ſhew why the Loadſtone draweth Iron, and the Amber and Jet Chaffe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſignes of the corruption of the bones.</note>The ſignes diſcovering the carioſitie of a bone, are either ſenſuall, or intellectuall.</p>
               <p>The ſenſuall are in number five.</p>
               <p>I. Is if the bone appeare black and fretted:<note place="margin">1. Senſuall.</note> Blackneſſe is cauſed by the corruption of the naturall temperature, by the which it is kept alwayes white with a ruddy glimps, or of an horſe-fleſh colour almoſt. Carioſitie is cauſed by the acrimony of humor fretting the ſubſtance of the bone.</p>
               <p>II. Is, when the bone being felt with a probe, doth not appeare ſmooth, but rugged.</p>
               <p>III. Is, if the probe ſlip not being guided into the bone; for then the Perioſtium muſt bee gone, and ſo the bone ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more or leſſe corrupted, partly by reaſon of the aire, partly by reaſon of the quittor ſettling upon the bone.</p>
               <p>IV. Is, if the fleſh ulcerate above the bone appeare ſoft and ſpungeous, or of a livid colour, it is to be doubted that the bone is corrupted: for when the bone is carious, the fleſh is made ſoft and corrupt, ſo that any one may thruſt a probe thorow it, without any great annoyance to the partie.</p>
               <p>V. Is this: if a tent or pledget reaching to the bone ſtink the next day when it is taken out, there is juſt occaſion offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſuſpect that the bone is carious.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Intellectuall.</note>The intellectuall ſignes are in number foure.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. Is, if more quittor doth flow from the ulcer, than the bigneſſe of it ſeemeth to afford.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. Is, if thin and ſtinking ſanies doth flow from the the ſore, it is probable that the bone is foule.</p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:16145:126"/>
               <p n="3">III. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> If an ulcer admit skinning, and often breake up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it may not without cauſe bee doubted that the bone is foule: for an humor ſtill flowing from the corrupt bone, doth cauſe a new inflammation, whereby the skin of a new is broken.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> IV. Is this. If an ulcer hath continued a long time, and is rebellious to proper medicaments, it may be thought that the bone is carious being much moyſtened, and ſo made ſoft by the quittor: and therefore muſt be ſcaled.</p>
               <p>As for the Prognoſticks:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aphor.</hi> 45. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. <hi>Prognoſes.</hi> 1.</note> Of ſuch ulcers as are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with carioſitie of the bone, receive theſe.</p>
               <p>I. No ulcer accompanied with the carioſitie of the bone is of eaſie curation: for it hath a malignitie annexed to the ſolution of unitie.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. If there happen a carioſitie paſſing the firſt table in either of the bones above the eye-browes, it will bee an hard matter to cicatrize it: If this be a true Aphoriſme in wounds dividing theſe parts, how much more true in ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: thoſe ondy cauſing a ſolution of unitie by an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſe; but theſe eroding the parts by an internall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: which for the moſt part is ſtill ſupplyed by ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſtemperature of ſome noble part.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> III. Shall be this: If any of the Vertebra's of the Spina prove foule, ſhun the cure: for firſt the ſubſtance of the Vertebrae being hollow, they will hardly ſcale: Secondly, it is an hard matter to come to apply a medicament unto them, by reaſon of the muſcules placed above them.

The tongues of Angels are not able to expreſſe what benefits doe redound unto man by the right ordering of the tongue, and what harmes and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences againe, when we give it free reines to laſh out. The frequent exhortations ſet downe in the holy Scripture to the firſt, and dehortations from the ſecond, may make us wary in our diſcourſes &amp; conferences.

               <p n="1">1. All ulcers of the lungs are hardly, or with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie cured, and that for foure cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the muſculs of the breaſt, lungs and heart, are in perpetuall motion: now motion hindereth conſolidati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as all by experience know.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the lungs are onely environed by the Pleura, the skin inwardly inveſting the ribs, which is endued but by ſmall ſtore of blood, and being a ſpermatick part, to wit, a membrane, is not eaſily united; and that onely by the ſecond intention.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe locall meanes cannot be kept to theſe ulcers, by rowling, bowlſtering, and emplaſtering, as they may to the ulcers of the externall parts.</p>
